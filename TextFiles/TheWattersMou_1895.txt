THE WATTER'S MOU’

I.
It threatened to be a wild night.
All day banks of sea-fog had come
and gone, sweeping on shore with
the southeast wind, which is so fatal
at Cruden Bay, and indeed all along
the coast of Aberdeenshire, and losing 
themselves in the breezy expanses 
of the high uplands beyond.
As yet the wind only came in puffs,
followed by intervals of ominous
calm ; but the barometer had been
falling for days, and the sky had on
the previous night been streaked


2 
with great “mare's-tails” running in
the direction of the dangerous wind.
Up to early morning the wind had
been southwesterly, but had then
“backed” to southeast; and the sudden
change, no less than the backing, 
was ominous indeed. From the
waste of sea came a ceaseless muffled
roar, which seemed loudest and most
full of dangerous import when it
came through the mystery of the
driving fog. Whenever the fog belts 
would lift or disperse, or disappear
inland before the gusts of
wind, the sea would look as though
swept with growing anger; for
though there were neither big
waves as during a storm, nor a
great swell as after one, all the surface 
of the water as far as the eye
could reach was covered with little
waves tipped with white. Closer


3
together grew these waves as the
day wore on, and angrier ever the
curl of the white water where they
broke. In the North Sea it does
not take long for the waves to rise;
and all along the eastern edge of
Buchan it was taken for granted
that there would be wild work on
the coast before the night was over.
In the little lookout house on
the top of the cliff over the tiny
harbor of Port Erroll the coastguard
 on duty was pacing rapidly
to and fro. Every now and again
he would pause, and, lifting a field-
glass from the desk, sweep the horizon 
from Girdleness, at the south of
Aberdeen, when the lifting of the
mist would let him see beyond the
Scaurs, away to the north, where
the high cranes of the Blackman
quarries at Murdoch Head seemed


4
to cleave the sky like gigantic gallows-trees.
He was manifestly in high spirits,
and from the manner in which, one
after another, he looked again and
again at the Martini-Henry rifle in
the rack, the navy revolver stuck
muzzle down on a spike, and the
cutlass in its sheath hanging on the
wall, it was easy to see that his interest 
arose from something connected 
with his work as a coastguard. 
On the desk lay an open
telegram smoothed down by his
hard hands, with the brown envelope 
lying beside it. It gave some
sort of clue to his excitement, although 
it did not go into detail:
“Keep careful watch to-night;
run expected; spare no efforts;
most important.”
William Barrow, popularly known


5
as Sailor Willy, was a very young
man to be a chief boatman in the
preventive service, albeit that his
station was one of the smallest on
the coast. He had been allowed,
as a reward of saving the life of
his lieutenant, to join the coast
service, and had been promoted
to chief boatman as a further reward 
for a clever capture of smugglers, 
wherein he had shown not
only great bravery, but much ability 
and power of rapid organization.

The Aberdeen coast is an important 
one in the way of guarding, 
on account of the vast number 
of fishing-Smacks which, during 
the season, work from Peterhead
up and down the coast, and away on
the North Sea right to the shores of
Germany and Holland. This vast

6
coming and going affords endless
opportunities for smuggling; and,
despite of all vigilance, a considerable 
amount of “stuff” finds its way
to the consumers without the formality 
of the Custom-house. The
fish-traffic is a quick traffic, and its
returns come all at once, so that a
truly enormous staff would be requisite 
to examine adequately the thousand 
fishing-Smacks which use the
harbor of Peterhead, and on Sundays 
pack its basins with a solid
mass of boats. The coast-line for
some forty miles south is favorable
for this illicit traffic. The gneiss
and granite formations, broken up
by every convulsion of nature, and
worn by the strain and toil of ages
into every conceivable form of rocky
beauty, offer an endless variety of
narrow creeks and bays where the

7
daring, to whom the rocks and the
currents and the tides are known,
may find secret entrance and speedy
exit for their craft. This season the
smuggling had been chiefly of an
overt kind—that is, the goods had
been brought into the harbor among
the fish and nets, and had been taken
through the streets under the eyes of
the unsuspecting Customs officers.
Some of these takes were so large
that the authorities had made up
their minds that there must be a
great amount of smuggling going
on. The secret agents in the German, 
Dutch, Flemish, and French
ports were asked to make extra exertions 
in discovering the amount of
the illicit trade, and their later reports 
were of an almost alarming
nature. They said that really vast
amounts of tobacco, brandy, rum,


8
silks, laces, and all sorts of excisable
commodities were being secretly
shipped in the British fishing-fleet;
and as only a very small proportion
of this was discovered, it was manifest 
that smuggling to a large extent 
was once more to the fore. Accordingly 
precautions were doubled
all along the east coast frequented
by the fishing-fleets. Not only were
the coast-guards warned of the danger 
and cautioned against devices
which might keep them from their
work at critical times, but they were
apprised of every new shipment as
reported from abroad. Furthermore, 
the detectives of the service
were sent about to parts where the
men were suspected of laxity—or
worse.
Thus it was that Sailor Willy,
with the experience of two promotions


9
for cause, and with the sense
of responsibility which belonged to
his office, felt in every way elated at
the possibility of some daring work
before him. He knew, of course,
that a similar telegram had been received 
at every station on the coast,
and that the chance of an attempt
being made in Cruden Bay or its
surroundings was a small one; but
he was young and brave and hopeful, 
and with an adamantine sense of
integrity to support him in his work.
It was unfortunate that his comrade
was absent, ill in the hospital at Aberdeen, 
and that the strain at present
on the service, together with the men
away on annual training and in the
naval manoeuvers, did not permit
of a substitute being sent to him.
However, he felt strong enough to
undertake any amount of duty—he


10
was strong enough and handsome
enough to have a good opinion of
himself, and too brave and too sensible 
to let his head be turned by
vanity.
. As he walked to and fro there was
in the distance of his mind—in that
dim background against which in a
man's mind a woman's form finds
suitable projection—some sort of
vague hope that a wild dream of
rising in the world might be some
time realized. He knew that every
precaution in his power had been
already taken, and felt that he could
indulge in fancies without detriment
to his work. He had signaled the
coast-guard at Whinnyfold, on the
south side of the Bay, and they had
exchanged ideas by means of the
signal language. His appliances
for further signaling by day or



11
night were in perfect order, and he
had been right over his whole
boundary since he had received the
telegram, seeing that all things
were in order. Willy Barrow was
not one to leave things to chance
where duty was concerned.
His day-dreams were not all selfish. 
They were at least so far un-
selfish that the results were to be
shared with another; for Willy
Barrow was engaged to be married. 
Maggie MacWhirter was the
daughter of an old fisherman who
had seen days more prosperous
than the present. He had once on
a time owned a fishing-Smack, but
by degrees he had been compelled
to borrow on her, till now, when,
although he was nominal owner,
the boat was so heavily mortgaged
that at any moment he might lose


12
his entire possession. That such
an event was not unlikely was
manifest, for the mortgagee was no
other than Solomon Mendoza, of
Hamburg and Aberdeen, who had
changed in like manner the ownership 
of a hundred boats, and who
had the reputation of being as remorseless 
as he was rich. MacWhirter 
had long been a widower, 
and Maggie, since a little
girl, had kept house for her father
and her two brothers, Andrew and
Niel. Andrew was twenty-seven—
six years older than Maggie—and
Niel had just turned twenty. The
elder brother was a quiet, self-contained, 
hard-working man, who now
and again manifested great determination, 
though generally at unexpected times ; 
the younger was
rash, impetuous, and passionate,


13
and though in his moments of
quiescence more tender to those
he cared for than was usual with
men of his class, he was a never-ending 
source of anxiety to his
father and his sister. Andrew, or
Sandy, as he was always called,
took him with consistent quietness.
The present year, although a
good one in the main, had been
but poor for MacWhirter's boat.
Never once had he had a good
take of fish—not one half the
number of crans of the best boat;
and the season was so far advanced,
and the supply had been so plentiful, 
that a few days before the notice 
had been up at Peterhead that
after the following week the buyers
would not take any more herring.
This notice naturally caused
much excitement, and the whole


14
fishing industry determined to
make every effort to improve the
shining hours left to them. Exertions 
were on all sides redoubled,
and on sea and shore there was
little idleness. Naturally the smuggling 
interest bestirred itself too;
its chance for the year was in the
rush and bustle and hurry of the
coming and going fleet, and anything 
held over for a chance had to
be ventured now or left over for
a year—which might mean indefinitely. 
Great ventures were therefore 
taken by some of the boats;
and from their daring the authorities 
concluded that either heavy
bribes were given or else that the
goods were provided by others
than the fishermen who undertook 
to run them. A few important 
seizures, however, made the


15
men wary; and it was understood,
from the less frequent but greater
importance of the seizures, that the
price for “running” had greatly
gone up. There was much passionate 
excitement among those
who were found out, and their
friends, and a general wish to discover 
the informers. Some of the
smuggling fishermen at first refused
to pay the fines until they were told
who had informed. This position
being unsupportable, they had instead 
paid the fines and cherished
hatred in their hearts. Some of the
more reckless and turbulent spirits
had declared their intention of
avenging themselves on the informers 
when they should be
known. It was only natural that
this feeling of rage should extend
to the Customs officers and men


16
of the preventive service, who stood
between the unscrupulous adventurers 
and their harvest; and altogether 
matters had become somewhat 
strained between the fishermen 
and the authorities.
The Port Erroll boats, like those
from Collieston, were all up at
Peterhead, and of course among
them MacWhirter's boat, the “Sea
Gull,” with her skipper and his two
sons. It was now Friday night,
and the boats had been out for several 
days, so that it was pretty certain 
that there would be a full harbor 
at Peterhead on the Saturday.
A marriage had been arranged to
take place this evening between
Thomas Keith, of Boddam, and
Alice MacDonald, whose father
kept the public-house, “The Jamie
Fleeman,” on the northern edge of


17
the Erroll estate. Though the occasion 
was to be a grand one, the
notice of it had been short indeed.
It was said by the bride's friends
that it had been fixed so hurriedly
because the notice of the closing
of the fishing season had been so
suddenly given out at Peterhead.
Truth to tell, some sort of explanaition 
was necessary, for it was
only on Wednesday morning that
word had been sent to the guests,
and as these came from all sorts
of places between Peterhead and
Collieston, and taking a sweep of
some ten miles inland, there was
need of some preparation. The affair 
was to top all that had ever
been seen at Port Erroll, and as
“The Jamie Fleeman" was but a
tiny place—nothing, in fact, but a
wayside public-house—it was arranged


18 
that it was to take place in
the new barn and storehouses Matthew 
Beagrie had just built on the
inner side of the sand-hills, where
they came close to the Water of
Cruden.
Throughout all the east side of
Buchan there had for some time
existed a wonder among the quiet-going 
people as to the strange prosperity 
of MacDonald. His public-house 
had, of course, a practical
monopoly; for as there was not a
licensed house on the Erroll estate,
and as his was the nearest house of
call to the port, he naturally got
what custom there was going. The
fishermen all along the coast for
some seven or eight miles went to
him either to drink or to get their
liquor for drinking elsewhere; and
not a few of the Collieston men, on


19
their Saturday journey home from
Peterhead and their Sunday journey
out there again, made a detour to
have a glass and a chat and a pipe,
if time permitted, with “Tammas
Mac”—for such was his sobriquet.
To the authorities he and his house
were also sources of interest; for
there was some kind of suspicion
that some of the excellent brandy
and cigars which he dispensed had
arrived by a simpler road than that
through the Custom-house. It was
at this house, in the good old days
of smuggling, that the coast-guards
used to be entertained when a run
was on foot, and where they slept
off their drunkenness while the cargoes 
were being hidden or taken inland 
in the ready carts. Of course
all this state of things had been altered, 
and there was as improved a


20
decorum among the smugglers as
there was a sterner rule and discipline 
among the coast-guards. It
was many a long year since Philip
Kennedy met his death at Kirkton
at the hands of the exciseman Anderson. 
Comparatively innocent
deception was now the smuggler's
only wile.
To-night the whole country-side
was to be at the wedding and the
dance which was to follow it; and
for this occasion the lion was to lie
down with the lamb, for the coastguards 
were bidden to the feast
with the rest. Sailor Willy had
looked forward to the dance with
delight, for Maggie was to be there,
and on the “Billy Ruffian,” which
had been his last ship, he had been
looked on as the best dancer before
the mast. If there be any man who


21
shuns a dance in which he knows
he can shine, and at which his own
particular girl is to be present, that
man is not to be found in the Royal
Naval Marine, even among those of
them who have joined in the preventive 
service. Maggie was no
less delighted, although she had a
source of grief which for the present 
she had kept all to herself.
Her father had of late been much
disturbed about affairs. He had
not spoken of them to her, and
she did not dare to mention the
matter to him; for old MacWhirter 
was a close-mouthed man, and
did not exchange many confidences
even with his own children. But
Maggie guessed at the cause of
the sadness—of the down-bent head
when none were looking; the sleepless 
nights and the deep smothered


22 
groans which now and again marked
his heavy sleep told the tale loudly
enough to reach the daughter's ears.
For the last few weeks, whenever
her father was at home, Maggie had
herself lain awake listening, listening, 
listening, in increasing agony
of spirit, for one of these half-moans
or for the sound of the tossing of
the restless man. He was as gentle
and kind to his daughter as ever;
but on his leaving the last time
there had been an omission on his
part which troubled her to the
quick. For the first time in his
life he had not kissed her as he
went away.
On the previous day Sailor Willy
had said he would come to the
wedding and the dance if his duties 
should permit him; and, when
asked if he could spare a few rockets


23
for the occasion, promised that
he would let off three Board of
Trade rockets, which he could now
deal with, as it was three months
since he had used any. He was
delighted at the opportunity of
meeting the fisherfolk and his
neighbors; for his officers had impressed 
on him the need of being
on good terms with all around him,
both for the possibility which it
would always afford him of knowing 
how things were going on, and
for the benefit of the rocket service
whenever there might be need of
willing hands and hearts to work
with him ; for in the Board of
Trade rocket service much depends
on voluntary aid. That very afternoon 
he had fixed the rockets on
the wall of the barn with staple, so
that he could fire them from below


24 
with a slow match, which he fixed
ready. When he had got the telegram 
he had called in to Maggie
and told her if he did not come to
fetch her she was to go on to the
wedding by herself, and that he
would try to join her later. She had
appeared a little startled when he
told her he might not be present;
but after a pause Smiled, and said
she would go, and that he was not to
lose any time coming when he was
free. Now that every arrangement
was complete, and as he had between 
puffs of the sea-fog got a
clean sweep of the horizon and
saw that there was no sail of any
kind within sight, he thought he
might have a look through the
village and keep in evidence, so as
not to create any suspicion in the
minds of the people. As he went


25
through the street he noticed that
nearly every house-door was closed
— all the women were at the new
barn. It was now eight o'clock,
and the darkness, which is slow of
coming in the North, was closing
in. Down by the barn there were
quite a number of carts, and the
horses had not been taken out,
though the wedding was not to be
till nine o'clock or perhaps even
later; for Mrs. MacDonald had
taken care to tell her friends that
Keith might not get over from
Boddam till late. Willy looked at
them carefully — some idea seemed
to have struck him. Their uttering 
showed them to be from all
parts round, and the names mostly
of those who had not the best reputation. 
When his brief survey was
finished he looked round and then


26 
went swiftly behind the barn, so
that no one might see him. As
he went he muttered reflectively:
“Too many light carts and fast
horses—too much silence in the
barn—too little liquor going to be
all safe. There's something up here
to-night.” He was under the lee of
the barn, and looked up where he
had fixed the rockets ready to fire.
This gave him a new idea.
“I fixed them low so as to go
over the sand-hills and not be noticeable 
at Collieston or beyond.
They are now placed up straight
and will be seen for fifty miles if
the weather be clear.”
It was too dark to see very
clearly, and he would not climb up
to examine them, lest he should be
noticed and his purpose of acquiring 
information frustrated ; but


 27
then and there he made up his
mind that Port Erroll or its neighborhood 
had been the spot chosen
for the running of the smuggled
goods. He determined to find out
more, and straightway went round
to the front and entered the room.



II.
As soon as Sailor Willy was seen
to enter, a large part of the gathering 
looked relieved, and at once began 
to chat and gabble in marked
contrast to their previous gloom
and silence. Port Erroll was well
represented by its womankind, and
by such of its men as were not away
at the fishing; for it was the intention 
to mask the Smuggling scheme
by an assemblage at which all the
respectability would be present.
There appeared to be little rivalry
between the two shoemakers, MacPherson 
and Beagrie, who chatted



 29
together in a corner, the former telling 
his companion how he had just
been down to the lifeboat-house to
see, as one of the Committee, that
it was all ready, in case it should be
wanting before the night was over.
Lang John and Lang Jim, the policemen 
of the place, looked sprucer
even than usual, and their buttons
shone in the light of the many
paraffin lamps as if they had been
newly burnished. Mitchell and his
companions of the salmon fishery
were grouped in another corner,
and Andrew Mason was telling
Mackay, the new flesher, whose
shed was erected on the edge of
the burn opposite John Reid's
shop, of a great crab which he had
taken that morning in a pot opposite 
the Twa Een.
But these and nearly all the other


3O 
Port Erroll folk present were quiet,
and their talk was of local interest ;
the main clack of tongues came
from the many strange men who
stood in groups near the center of
the room and talked and laughed
loudly. In the midst of them was
the bridegroom, more joyous than
any, though in the midst of his
laughter he kept constantly turning 
to look at the door. The
minister from Peterhead sat in a
corner with the bride and her
mother and father—the latter of
whom, despite his constant laughter, 
had an anxious look on his face.
Sailor Willy was greeted joyously,
and the giver of the feast and the
bridegroom each rose, and, taking
a bottle and glass, offered him a
drink.
“To the bride,” said he ; but seeing


3I
that no one else was drinking,
he tapped the bridegroom on the
shoulder. “Come, drink this with
me, my lad!” he added. The latter
paused an instant and then helped
himself from MacDonald's bottle.
Willy did not fail to notice the act,
and, holding out his glass, said:
“Come, my lad, you drink with
me! Change glasses in old style !”
An odd pallor passed quickly across
the bridegroom's face, but MacDonald 
spoke quickly:
“Tak it, mon, tak it !” So he
took the glass, crying, “No heeltaps! " 
threw back his head, and
raised the glass. Willy threw back
his head too, and tossed off his
liquor; but, as he did so, took care
to keep a sharp eye on the other,
and saw him, instead of swallowing
his liquor, pour it into his thick



32 
beard. His mind was quite made
up now. They meant to keep him
out of the way by fair means or
foul.
Just then two persons entered
the room, one of them James
Cruickshank, of the Kilmarnock
Arms, who was showing the way
to the other, an elderly man with a
bald head, keen eyes, a ragged gray
beard, a hooked nose, and an evil
smile. As he entered MacDonald
jumped up and came over to greet
him :
“O Mr. Mendoza, this is brawl
We hopit tae see ye the nicht, but
we were that feard that ye wadna
come.”
“Mein Gott! but why shall I not
come, on this occasion of all—the
occasion of the marriage of the
daughter of mein goot frien, Tam



 33
Smack P And moreovers when I
bring these as I haf promise: for
you, mein frien Keith, this check,
which one week you cash, and for
you, my tear Miss Alice, these so
bright necklace, which you will
wear, ant which will sell if so you
choose.”
As he spoke he handed his gifts
to the groom and bride. He then
walked to the corner where Mrs.
Mac sat, exchanging a keen look
with his host as he did so. The
latter seemed to have taken his
cue, and spoke out at once:
“And now, reverend sir, we may
proceed—all is ready.” As he
spoke the bridal pair stood up,
and the friends crowded round.
Sailor Willy moved toward the
door, and just as the parson opened
his book began to pass out. Tammas



34 
Mac immediately spoke to
him :
“Ye're no gangin', Sailor Willy P
Sure ye'll wait and see Tam Keith
marrit on my lass?”
He instantly replied:
“I must go for a while. I have
some things to do, and then I want
to try to bring Maggie down for
the dance”; and before anything
could be said he was gone.
The instant he left the door he
slipped round to the back of the
barn, and, running across the sandhills 
to the left, crossed the wooden
bridge, and, hurrying up the roadway 
by the cottage on the cliff,
gained the watch-house. He knew
that none of the company in the
barn could leave till the service
was over, with the minister's eye
on them, without giving cause for


 35
after suspicion; and he knew, too,
that as there were no windows on
the south side of the barn, nothing 
could be seen from that side.
Without a moment's delay he arranged 
his signals for the call for
aid; and as the rockets whizzed
aloft, sending a white glare far into
the sky, he felt that the struggle
had entered on its second stage.
The night had now set in with a
darkness unusual in August. The
swaths of sea-mist whirled in by the
wind came fewer and fainter, and
at times a sudden rift through the
driving clouds showed that there
was starlight somewhere between
the driving masses of mist and
gloom. Willy Barrow once more
tried all his weapons and saw that
all his signals were in order. Then
he strapped the revolver and the


36 
cutlass in his belt, and lit a dark
lantern, so that it might be ready in
case of need. This done, he left the
watch-house, locking the door be-
hind him, and, after looking steadily 
across the Bay to the Scaurs beyond, 
turned and walked northward
toward the Watter's Mou'. Between 
the cliff on the edge of this
and the watch-house there was a
crane used for raising the granite
boulders quarried below; and when
he drew near this he stopped instinctively, 
and called out, “Who is
there?” for he felt, rather than saw,
some presence.
“It is only me, Willy,” came
a soft voice, and a woman drew
a step nearer through the darkness 
from behind the shaft of the
Cran C.
“Maggie | Why, darling, what


 37
brings you here 2 I thought you
were going to the wedding P”
“I knew ye wadna be there, and
I wanted tae speak wi' ye.” This
was said in a very low voice.
“How did you know I wouldn't
be there? I was to join you if I
could.”
“I saw Bella Cruickshank hand
ye the telegram as ye went by the
Post-office, and—and I knew there
would be something tae keep ye.
O Willy, Willy! why do ye draw
awa frae me P” for Sailor Willy
had instinctively loosened his arms,
which were round her, and had
drawn back—in the instant his love
and his business seemed as though
antagonistic. He answered, with
blunt truthfulness: -
“I was thinking, Maggie, that I
had no cause to be making love



38
here and now ; I've got work, mayhap, 
to-night !”
“I feared so, Willy—I feared
sol” Willy was touched, for it
seemed to him that she was anxious 
for him, and answered tenderly:
“All right, dear ! All right!
There's no danger. Why, if need
be, I am armed,” and he slipped his
hand on the butt of the revolver in
his belt. To his surprise Maggie
uttered a deep low groan, and turning 
away sat on the turf bank beside 
her, as though her strength was
failing her. Willy did not know
what to say, so there was a span of
silence. Then Maggie went on hurriedly:
“O my God! it is a dreadful
thing to lift yer han' in sic a deadly
manner against yer neighbors, and



 39
ye not knowing what woe ye may
cause." Willy could answer this
time:
“Aye, lass, it's hard indeed, and
that's the truth. But that's the very
reason that men like me are put
here, that can and will do their duty
no matter how hard it may be.”
Another pause, and then Maggie
spoke again. Willy could not see
her face, but she seemed to speak
between gasps for breath.
“Ye're lookin' for hard wark the
nicht P”
“I am—I fear so.”
“I can guess that that telegram
tellt ye that some boats would try
to rin in somewhere the nicht.”
“Mayhap, lass. But the telegrams 
are Secret, and I must not
speak of what's in them.”
After a long pause Maggie spoke


40 
again, but in a voice so low that he
could hardly hear her amid the roar
of the breaking waves which came
in on the wind :
“Willy, ye're not a cruel man
Ye wadna, if ye could help it, dae
harm to them that loved ye, or wark
woe to their belongin's P”
“My lass, that I wouldn't.” As
he answered he felt a horrible sinking 
of the heart. What did all this
mean? Was it possible that Maggie, 
too, had any interest in the
smuggling 2 No, no a thousand
times no! Ashamed of his suspicion, 
he drew closer and again put
his arm around her in a protecting
way. The unexpected tenderness
overcame her, and, bursting into
tears, she threw herself on Willy's
neck, and whispered to him between
her sobs :


 41
“O Willy, Willy I'm in sic sair
trouble, and there's name that I can
speak tae—nae, not ane in the wide
warld.”
“Tell me, darling; you know
you'll soon be my wife, and then
I'll have a right to know all.”
“Oh, I canna | I canna | I can-
na!” she said, and taking her arms
from round his neck she beat her
hands wildly together. Willy was
something frightened, for a woman's
distress touches a strong man in direct 
ratio to his manliness. He tried
to soothe her, as though she were a
frightened child, and held her tight
to him.
“There, there, my darling, don't
cry ! I'm here with you, and you
can tell me all your trouble.” She
shook her head; he felt the movement 
on his breast, and he went on :



42 
“Don’t be frightened, Maggie;
tell me all. Tell me quietly, and
mayhap I can help ye out over the
difficult places.” Then he remained
silent, and her sobs grew less violent. 
At last she raised her head
and dashed away her tears fiercely
with her hand. She dragged herself
away from him. He tried to stop
her, but she said:
“Nae, nae, Willy, dear; let me
speak in my ain way. If I canna
trust ye, wha can I trust? My
trouble is not for mysel'.” She
paused, and he asked:
“Who, then, is it for?”
“My father and my brothers.”
Then she went on hurriedly, fearing 
to stop, lest her courage should
fail her, and he listened in dead
silence, with a growing pain in his
heart.


 43
“Ye ken that for several seasons
back our boat has had bad luck
- we took less fish and lost mair nets
than any of the boats; even on the
land everything went wrong. Our
coo died, and the shed was blown
doon, and then the blight touched
the potatoes in our field. Father
could dae nothing, and had to borrow 
money on the boat to go on
with his wark; and the debt grew
and grew, till now he only owns her
in name, and we never ken when we
may be sold up. And the man that
has the mortgage isn't like to let us
off or gie time !”
“Who is he P. His name P” said
Willy, hoarsely.
“Mendoza—the man frae Hamburg 
who lends to the boats at
Peterhead.”
Willy groaned. Before his eyes


44
rose the vision of that hard, cruel,
white face that he had seen only a
few minutes ago, and again he saw
him hand out the presents with
which he had bought the man and
the woman to help in his wicked
scheme. When Maggie heard the
groan her courage and her hope
arose. If her lover could take the
matter so much to heart all might
yet be well, and in the moment all
the womanhood in her awoke to the
call. Her fear had broken down the
barriers that had kept back her passion, 
and now the passion came with
all the force of a virgin nature. She
drew Willy close to her — closer still
—and whispered to him in a low,
sweet voice that thrilled with emotion:
“Willy, Willy, darlin', you would-
na see harm come to my father — my


45
father, my father!” and in a wave of
tumultuous, voluptuous passion she
kissed him full in the mouth. Willy
felt for the moment half dazed. Love
has its opiates, that soothe and stun
even in the midst of their activity.
He clasped Maggie close in his
arms, and for a moment their hearts
beat together and their mouths
breathed the same air. Then Willy
drew back, but Maggie hung limp
in his arms. The silence which
hung in the midst of nature's tumult 
broke its own spell. Willy
realized what and where he was ;
with the waves dashing below his
feet, and the night wind, laden
with drifting mist, wreathing around
him in the darkness, and whistling
among the rocks, and screaming
sadly through the ropes and stays
of the flagstaff on the cliff. There


46 
was a wild fear in his heart, and a
burning desire to know all that was
in his sweetheart's mind.
“Go on, Maggie I go on 1" he
said. Maggie roused herself, and
again took up the thread of her
story, this time in feverish haste.
The moment of passion had disquieted 
and disturbed her. She
seemed to herself to be two people,
one of whom was new to her, and
whom she feared; but, woman-like,
she felt that as she had begun so
must she go on, and thus her
woman's courage sustained her.
“Some weeks ago father began
to get letters frae Mr. Mendoza,
and they aye upset him. He wrote
answers and sent them away at
once. Then Mr. Mendoza sent him
a telegram frae Hamburg, and he
sent a reply; and a month ago


 47
father got a telegram telling him to
meet him at Peterhead. He was
very angry at first and very low-spirited 
after ; but he went to
Peterhead, and when he cam back
he was very still and quite pale. He
would eat naething, and went to bed,
although it was only seven o'clock.
Then there were more letters and
telegrams, but father answered nane
o' them—so far as I ken—and then
Mr. Mendoza cam to our hoose.
Father got as pale as a sheet when
he saw him, and then he got red and
angry, and I thocht he was going to
strike him ; but Mr. Mendoza said
not to frichten his dauchter, and
father got quiet and sent me oot on
a message to the Nether Mill. And
when I cam back Mr. Mendoza had
gone, and father was sitting with his
face in his hands, and he didna hear


48 
me come in. When I spoke he
started up, and he was as white as a
sheet; and then he mumbled something 
and went into his room. And
ever since then he hardly spoke to
any one, and seemed to avoid me
a'thegither. When he went away
the last time he never even kissed
me. And so, Willy—so I fear that
that awfu' Mr. Mendoza has made
him dae something that he didna
want tae dae, and it's all breaking
my heart!” and again she laid her
head on her lover's breast and
sobbed. Willy breathed more free-
ly; but he could not be content
to remain in doubt, and his courage 
was never harder tried than
when he asked his next question.
“Then, Maggie, you don't know
anything for certain P”



49
“Naething, Willy; but I fear.”
“But there may be nothing after
all!” Maggie's hopes rose again,
for there was something in her lover's 
voice which told her that he was
willing to cling to any straw, and
once again her woman's nature took
advantage of her sense of right and
wrong.
“Please God, Willy, there may be
naething! but I fear much that it
may be so. But we must act as
if we didna fear. It wadna do to
suspeck poor father without some
cause. You know, Willy, the Earl
has promised to mak him the new
harbor-master. Old Forgie is bedridden 
now, and when winter comes
he'll no even be able to pretend to
wark, so the Earl is to pension him,
and father will get the post and hae
the hoose by the harbor; and you


50
know that every one's sae glad, for
they all respect father.”
“Aye, lass,” interrupted Willy,
“that's true; and why, then, should
we—you and me, Maggie—think he
would do ill to please that damned
scoundrel, Mendoza P”
“Indeed, I'm thinkin' that it's just
because that he is respeckit that
Mendoza wants him to help him.
He kens weel that name would suspeck 
father, and "–here she clipped
her lover close in her arms once
again, and her breath came hot in
his face till it made him half drunk
with a voluptuous intoxication— 
“he kens that father—my father
—would never be harmt by my
lover !”
Even then, at the moment when
the tragedy of his life seemed to be
accomplished, when the woman he


 51
loved and honored seemed to be
urging him to some breach of duty,
Willy Barrow could not but feel
that some responsibility for her action 
rested on him. That first passionate 
kiss which had seemed to
unlock the very gates of her soul —
in which she had yielded herself to
him — had some mysterious bond or
virtue like that which abides in the
wedding-ring. The Maggie who
thus acted was his Maggie, and in
all that came of it he had a part.
But his mind was made up : nothing — 
not Maggie's kisses or Maggie's 
fears — would turn him from
his path of duty; and strong in this
resolution, he could afford to be
silent to the woman in his arms.
Maggie instinctively knew that silence 
could now be her best weapon,
and said no word as they walked


52 
toward the guard-house, Willy cast-
ing keen looks seaward and up and
down the coast as they went. When
they were so close that in its shelter
the roar of the surge seemed muffled, 
Maggie again nestled close to
her lover, and whispered in his ear
as he looked out over Cruden
Bay:
“The “Sea Gull' comes hame the
nicht!” Willy quivered, but said
nothing for a time that seemed to
be endless. Then he answered:
“They'll find it hard to make the
Port to-night. Look! the waves
are rolling high, and the wind is
getting up. It would be madness
to try it.” Again she whispered to
him :
“Couldna she rin in somewhere
else ? There are other openings
besides Port Erroll in Buchan !"


 53
Willy laughed the laugh of a strong
man who knew well what he said:
“Other openings? Aye, lass,
there are other openings; but the
coble isn't built that can run them
this night. With a southeast gale,
who would dare to try 2–the Bullers, 
or Robies Haven, or Dunbuy,
or Twa Havens, or Lang Haven,
or the Watter's Mou'. Why, lass,
they'd be in matches on the rocks
before they could turn their tiller
or slack a sail.”
She interrupted him, speaking
with a despairing voice:
“Then ye'll no hae to watch nane
o' them the nicht?” .
“Nay, Maggie. Port Erroll is
my watch to-night, and from it I
won't budge."
“And the Watter's Mou',” she
asked, “is that no safe wi'oot watch?


54 (the tuatter's ſilon'.
It's no far frae the Port.” Again
Willy laughed his arrogant, masculine 
laugh, which made Maggie, despite 
her trouble, admire him more
than ever, and he answered :
“The Watter's Mou'? To try to
get in there in this wind would be
to court sudden death. Why, lass,
it would take a man all he knew to
get out from there, let alone get in,
in this weather | And then the
chances would be ten to one that
he'd be dashed to pieces on the
rocks beyond;” and he pointed to
where a line of sharp rocks rose between 
the billows on the south side
of the inlet. Truly it was a fearful - 
looking place to be dashed on, for
the great waves broke on the rocks
with a loud roaring, and even in the
semi-darkness they could see the
white lines as the waters poured


55
down to leeward in the wake of the
heaving wave. The white cluster
of rocks looked like a ghostly
mouth opened to swallow whatever 
might come in touch. Maggie 
shuddered; but some sudden
idea seemed to strike her, and she
drew away from her lover for a
moment, and looked toward the
black, cleft in the rocks, of which
they could just see the top from
where they stood — the entrance to
the Watter's Mou'.
And then with one long, wild, appealing 
glance skyward, as though
looking a prayer which she dared
not utter even in her heart, Maggie
turned toward her lover once more.
Again she drew close to him, and
hung around his neck, and said,
with many gasps and pauses between 
her words:


56 
“If the “Sea Gull' should come
in tae the Port the nicht, and if ony
attempt that ye feared should tak
you away to Whinnyfold or to
Dunbuy, so that you might be a
bit—only a wee bit—late tae search
when the boat cam in-”
She stopped affrighted, for Willy
put her from him to arm's - length —
not too gently either—and said to
her, so sternly that each word
seemed to smite her like the lash
of a whip, till she shrunk and
quivered and cowered away from
him :
“Maggie, lass, what's this you're
saying to me? It isn't fit for you
to speak or me to hear! It's bad
enough to be a smuggler, but what
is it that you would make of me?
Not only a smuggler, but a perjurer 
and a traitor too! God! am


 57
I mistaken 2 Is it you, Maggie,
that would make this of me? Of
me! Maggie MacWhirter, if this be
your counsel, then God help us
both you are no fit wife for me!”
In an instant the whole truth
dawned on Maggie of what a thing
she would make of the man she
loved, whom she had loved at the
first because he was strong and
brave and true. In the sudden revulsion 
of her feelings she flung
herself on her knees beside him,
and took his hand and held it
hard, and, despite his efforts to withdraw 
it, kissed it wildly in the humility 
of her self-abasement, and
poured out to him a passionate
outburst of pleading for his forgiveness, 
of justification of herself,
and of appeals to his mercy for her
father.


58 
“O Willy, Willyl dinna turn frae
me this nicht! My heart is sae ſu'
o' trouble that I am nigh mad! I
dinna ken what tae dae nor where
to look for help ! I think and think
and think, and everywhere there is
naught but dark before me, just as
there is blackness oot ower the sea
when I look for my father. And
noo when I want ye to help me —
ye that are all I hae, and the only
ane on earth that I can look tae
in my wae and trouble—I can do
no more than turn ye frae me !
Ye that I love — oh, love more than
my life or my soul! — I must dishonor 
and mak ye hate me! Oh,
what shall I dae? what shall I dae?
what shall I dae?” and again she
beat the palms of her hands together 
in a paroxysm of wild despair, 
while Willy looked on with his


59
heart full of pain and pity, though
his resolution never flinched. And
then through the completeness of
her self-abasement came the pleading 
of her soul from a depth of her
nature even deeper than despair.
Despair has its own bravery, but
hope can sap the strongest resolution. 
And the pleadings of love
came from the depths of that Pandora's 
box which we call human
nature.
“O Willy, Willy forgie me, forgie 
me ! I was daft to say what I
did I was daft to think that ye
would be so base—daft to think
that I would like you to so betray 
yoursel'ſ Forgie me, Willy,
forgie me, and tak my wild words
as spoken not tae ye, but to the
storm that maks me feel sae for my
father | Let me tak it all back,


60
Willy, darlin'—Willy, my Willy —
and dinna leave me desolate here
with this new shadow ower me !”
Here, as she kissed his hand again,
her lover stooped and raised her in
his strong arms and held her to him.
And then, when she felt herself in a
position of security, the same hysterical 
emotion came sweeping up
in her brain and her blood — the
same self-abandonment to her lover
overcame her—and the current of
her thought once again turned
to win from him something by
the force of her woman's wile
and her woman's contact with the
Iſlan.
“Willy,” she whispered, as she
kissed him on the mouth and then
kissed his head on the side of his
neck — “Willy, ye have forgien me,
I ken; and I ken that ye’ll harm


 61
father nae mair than ye can help,
but if—”
What more she was going to say
she hardly knew herself. As for
Willy, he felt that something better
left unsaid was coming, and unconsciously
 his muscles stiffened till he
held her from him rather than to
him. She, too, felt the change, and
held him closer — closer still—with
the tenacity induced by a sense of
coming danger. Their difficulty was
solved for them, for just on the instant 
when the suggestion of treachery 
to his duty was hanging on her
lips there came from the village below, 
in a pause between the gusts
of wind, the fierce roar of a flying
rocket. Up and up and up, as
though it would never stop — up it
rose with its prolonged screech, increasing 
in sound at the first, till it



62 
began to die away in the aërial
heights above, so that when the
explosion came it seemed to startle
a quietude around it. Up in the
air a thousand feet over their heads
the fierce glitter of the falling fires
of red and blue made a blaze of
light which lit up the coast - line
from the Scaurs to Dunbuy; and
with an instinctive intelligence
Willy Barrow took in all he saw,
including the many men at the little 
port below, sheltering under the
sea-wall from the sweeping of the
waves as they looked out seaward.
Instinctively, also, he counted the
seconds till the next rocket should
be fired—one, two, three ; and then
another roar and another blaze of
colored lights. And then another
pause—of six seconds this time — 
and then the third rocket sped


63
aloft with its fiery message. And
then the darkness seemed blacker
than ever, and the mysterious booming 
of the sea to grow louder and
louder, as though it came through
silence. By this time the man and
the woman were apart no less in
spirit than physically. Willy, intent 
on his work, was standing outside 
the window of the guard-house,
whence he could see all around the
Bay and up and down the coast,
and at the same time command the
whole of the harbor. His feet were
planted wide apart, for on the exposed 
rock the sweep of the wind
was strong; and as he raised his
arm with his field-glass to search
the horizon the wind drove back
his jacket and showed the butt of
his revolver and the hilt of his cutlass. 
Maggie stood a little behind


64 
him, gazing seaward with no less
eager eyes, for she, too, expected
what would follow. Her heart
seemed to stand still, though her
breath came in quick gasps; and
she did not dare to make a sound
or to encroach on the business - like
earnestness of the man. For full a
minute they waited thus, and then
far off at sea, away to the south,
they saw a faint blue light, and then
another and another, till at last three
lights were burning in a row. Instantly 
from the town a single rocket
went up — not this time a great Board
of Trade rocket, laden with colored
fire, but one which left a plain white
track of light behind it. Willy gazed
seaward, but there was no more sign
from the far-off ship at sea; the signal, 
whatever it was, was complete.
The coast-guard was uncertain as to


 65
the meaning, but to Maggie no explanation 
was necessary. There,
away at sea, tossed on the stormy
waters, was her father. There was
danger round him, but a greater
danger on the shore. Every way of
entrance was barred by the storm — 
save the one where, through his fatal 
cargo, dishonor lay in wait for
him. She seemed to see her duty
clear before her, and come what
might she meant to do it : her
father must be warned. It was
with a faint voice indeed that she
now spoke to her lover:
“willy 1"
His heart was melted at the faltering 
voice, but he feared she was
trying some new temptation, so,
coldly and hardly enough, he answered :
“What is it, lass?”


66 
“Willy, ye wadna see poor father
injured P”
“No, Maggie, not if I could help
it. But I'd have to do my duty all
the same.”
“And we should a' dae oor duty
—whatever it might be — at a'
costs P”
“Aye, lass, at all costs !” His
voice was firm enough now, and
there was no mistaking the truth
of its ring. Maggie's hope died
away. From the stern task which
seemed to rise before her over the
waste of the black sea she must
not shrink. There was but one
more yielding to the weakness of
her fear; and she said, so timidly
that Willy was startled, the voice
and manner were so different from
those he had ever known :
“And if—mind I say 'if' Willy—


67
I had a duty tae dae, and it was ful
o' fear and danger, and ye could save
me frae it, wad ye P” As she waited
for his reply her heart beat so fast
and so heavily that Willy could hear
it; her very life, she felt, lay in his
answer. He did not quite understand 
the full import of her words
and all that they implied, but he
knew that she was in deadly earnest, 
and he felt that some vague
terror lay in his answer; but the
manhood in him rose to the occasion — 
Willy Barrow was of the stuff
of which heroes are made — and he
replied:
“Maggie, as God is above us, I
have no other answer to give I
don't know what you mean, but I
have a shadow of a fear. I must do
my duty whatever comes of it !”
There was a long pause, and then


68 
Maggie spoke again, but this time
in so different a voice that her lover's 
heart went out to her in ten -
ſold love and passion, with never a
shadow of doubt or fear:
“Willy, tak me in your arms — I
am not unworthy, dear, though for a
moment I did falter!" He clasped
her close to him, and whispered,
when their lips had met:
“Maggie, my darling, I never
loved you like now. I would die
for you if I could do you good.” -
“Hush, dear! I ken it weel. But
your duty is not only for yoursel',
and it must be done! I, too, hae a
duty tae dae—a grave and stern
ane!"
“What is it? Tell me, Maggie,
dear!”
“Ye maunna ask me ! Ye maun
never ken Kiss me once again,


69
Willy, before I go—for oh, my love,
my love 1 it may be the last!”
Her words were lost in the passionate 
embrace which followed.
Then, when he least expected it,
she suddenly tore herself away and
fled through the darkness across the
field which lay between them and
her home; while he stood doggedly
at his watch, looking out for another
signal between sea and shore.


III.
WHEN she got to the far side of
the field, Maggie, instead of turning 
to the left, which would have
brought her home, went down the
sloping track to the right, which
led to the rustic bridge crossing the
Back Burn near the Pigeon Tower.
Thence turning to the right, she
scrambled down the bank beside
the ruined Barley-mill, so as to
reach the little plots of sea grass —
islands, except at low tide — between
which the tide rises to meet the waters 
of the stream.
The whole situation of Cruden is
70


 71
peculiar. The main stream, the Water of 
Cruden, runs in a southeasterly 
direction, skirts the sand-hills,
and, swirling under the stone bridge,
partly built with the ruins of the old
church which Malcolm erected to
celebrate his victory over Sueno,
turns suddenly to the right and runs
to sea over a stony bottom. The
estuary has in its wash some dangerous 
outcropping granite rocks,
nearly covered at high tide, and
the Mouth opens between the most
northerly end of the sand-hills and
the village street, whose houses
mark the slope of the detritus from
the rocks. Formerly the Water of
Cruden, instead of taking this last
turn, used to flow straight on till it
joined the lesser stream known as
the Back Burn, and together the
streams ran Seaward. Even in comparatively


72 
recent years, in times of
flood or freshet, the spate broke
down or swept over the intervening 
tongue of land, and the Water
of Cruden took its old course seaward. 
This course is what is known
as the Watter's Mou'. It is a natural 
cleft — formed by primeval fire or
earthquake, or some sort of natural
convulsion — which runs through the
vast mass of red granite which forms
a promontory running due south.
Water has done its work as well as
fire in the formation of the gully as
it now is, for the drip and flow and
rush of water that mark the seasons
for countless ages have completed
the work of the pristine fire. As
one sees this natural mouth of the
stream in the rocky face of the cliff,
it is hard to realize that Nature
alone has done the work.


 73
At first the cleft runs from west
to east, and broadens out into a wide
bay, of which on one side a steep
grassy slope leads toward the new
castle of Slains, and on the other
rises a sheer bank, with tufts of the
thick grass growing on the ledges
where the earth has been blown.
From this the cleft opens again between 
towering rocks like what in
America is called a caſion, and tends
seaward to the south between precipices 
two hundred feet high, and
over a bottom of great boulders
exposed at low water toward the
northern end. The precipice to the
left or eastward side is twice rent
with great openings, through which,
in time of storm, the spray and
spume of the easterly storm, piling
the great waves into the Castle Bay,
are swept. These openings are, however,


74 
so guarded with masses of rock
that the force of the wildest wave is
broken before it can leap up the
piles of boulders which rise from
their sandy floors. At the very
mouth the cleft opens away to the
west, where the cliff falls back, and
seaward of which rise great masses
of black, frowning rock, most of
which only show their presence at
high water by the angry patches of
foam which even in calm weather
mark them—for the current here
runs fast. The eastern portal is
composed of a giant mass of red
granite, which, from its overhanging 
shape, is known as “the Ship's
Starn.” It lies somewhat lower
than the cliff of which it is a part,
being attached to it by a great sloping 
shelf of granite, over which,
when the storm is easterly, the torrent



75
of spray sent up by the dashing
waves rolls down to join the foamy
waves in the Watter's Mou'.
Maggie knew that close to the
Barley-mill, safe from the onset of
the waves—for the wildest waves
that ever rise lose their force fretting 
and churning on the stony sides
and bottom of the Watter's Mou'—
was kept a light boat belonging to
her brother, which he sometimes
used when the weather was fine
and he wanted to utilize his spare
time in line-fishing. Her mind was
made up that it was her duty to
give her father warning of what
awaited him on landing—if she
could. She was afraid to think of
the danger—of the myriad chances
against her success; but, woman -
like, when once the idea was fixed
in her mind, she went straight on


76
to its realization. Truly, thought
of any kind would have been an absolute 
barrier to action in such a
case, for any one of the difficulties
ahead would have seemed sufficient.
To leave the shore at all on such a
night, and in such a frail craft, with
none but a girl to manage it; then
to find a way, despite storm and
current, out to the boat so far off
at sea; and, finally, to find the boat
she wanted at all in the fret of such
a stormy sea—a wilderness of driving 
mist — on such a night, when
never a star, even, was to be seen
The prospect might well appal the
bravest.
But to think was to hesitate, and
to hesitate was to fail. Keeping
her thoughts on the danger to her
father, and seeing through the
blackness of the stormy night his


 77
white, woe-laden face before her,
and hearing through the tumult of
the tempest his sobs as on that
night when her fear for him began
to be acute, she set about her work
with desperate energy. The boat
was moored on the northern side
of the largest of the little islands of
sea-grass, and so far in shelter that
she could get all in readiness. She
set the oars in their places, stepped
the mast, and rigged the sail ready
to haul up. Then she took a small
spar of broken wood and knotted
to it a piece of rope, fastening the
other end of the rope, some five
yards long, just under the thwarts
near the center of the boat, and
just a little forward on the port
side. The spar she put carefully
ready to throw out of the boat
when the sweep of the wind should



78
take her sail, for without some such
strain as it would afford, the boat
would probably heel over. Then
she guided the boat in the shallow
water round the little island till it
was stern on to the sea side. It
was rough work, for the rush and
recoil of the waves beat the boat
back on the sandy bank, or left her
now and again dry, till a new wave
lifted her.
All this time she took something
of inspiration from the darkness and
the roar of the storm around her.
She was not yet face to face with
danger, and did not realize, or try
to realize, its magnitude. In such
a mystery of darkness as lay before,
above, and around her, her own personality 
seemed as naught. Truly
there is an instinct of one's own littleness 
which becomes consciously


 79
manifest in the times when Nature
puts forth her might. The wind
swept up the channel of the Watter's Mou' 
in great gusts, till the
open bay where she stood became
the center of an intermittent whirlwind. 
The storm came not only
from the Mouth itself, but through
the great gaps in the eastern wall.
It drove across the gully till high
among the rocks overhead on both
sides it seemed now and again to
scream as a living thing in pain or
anger. Great sheets of mist appeared 
out of the inky darkness beyond, 
coming suddenly, as though
like the great sails of ships driving
up before the wind. With gladness
Maggie saw that the sheets of fog
were becoming fewer and thinner,
and realized that so far her dreadful
task was becoming possible. She


80
was getting more inspired by the
sound and elemental fury around
her. There was in her blood, as in
the blood of all the hardy children
of the northern seas, some strain of
those sturdy Berserkers who knew
no fear and rode the very tempest
on its wings with Supreme bravery.
Such natures rise with the occasion,
and now, when the call had come,
Maggie's brave nature answered it.
It was with a strong, almost an
eager, heart that she jumped into
the boat, and, seizing the oars, set
out on her perilous course. The
start was difficult, for the boat was
bumping Savagely on the Sand; but,
taking advantage of a big wave, two
or three powerful strokes took her
out into deeper water. Here, too,
there was shelter, for the cliffs rose
steeply; and when she had entered


81
the elbow of the gully, and saw before 
her the whole length of the
Watter's Mou', the drift of the wind
took it over her head, and she was
able to row in comparative calmness
under the shadow of the cliffs. A
few minutes took her to the first of
the openings in the eastern cliff, and
here she began to feel the full fury
of the storm. The opening itself
was sheer on each side, but in the
gap between was piled a mass of
giant boulders, the work of the sea
at its wildest during centuries of
stress. On the farther side of these
the waves broke, and sent up a white
cloud of spume that drove instantly
into the darkness beyond. Maggie
knew that here her first great effort
had to be made, and, lending her
strength, pulled the boat through
the turmoil of wind and wave. As


82 
she passed the cleft, driven somewhat 
more out into the middle of
the channel, she caught, in a pause
between the rush of the waves, a
glimpse of the lighted windows of
the Castle on the cliff. The sight
for an instant unnerved her, for it
brought into opposition her own
dreadful situation, mental and physical, 
with the happy faces of those
clustered round the comforting light.
But the reaction was helpful, for the
little jealousy which was at the base
of the idea was blotted out by the
thought of that stern and paramount 
duty which she had undertaken. 
Not seldom in days gone
by had women like her, in times of
test and torment, taken their way
over the red-hot plowshares under
somewhat similar stress of mind.
She was now under the shelter of


83
the cliff, and gaining the second and
last opening in the rocky wall. As
the boat advanced the force of the
waves became greater, for every
yard up the Watter's Mou' the fretting 
of the rocky bottom and sides
had broken their force. This was
brought home to her roughly when
the breaking of a coming wave threw
a sheet of water over her as she bent
to her oars. Chop ! chop ! went the
boat into the trough of each succeeding 
wave, till it became necessary 
to bale out the boat or she
might never even get started on
her way. This done, she rowed on,
and now came to the second opening 
in the cliff. This was much
wilder than the first, for outside of
it, to the east, the waves of the
North Sea broke in all their violence, 
and with the breaking of each


84
a great sheet of water came drifting
over the wall of piled-up boulders.
Again Maggie kept out in the channel, 
and, pulling with all her might,
passed again into the shelter of the
cliff. Here the water was stiller, for
the waves were breaking directly
behind the sheltering cliff, and the
sound of them was heard high overhead 
in the rushing wind.
Maggie drew close to the rock,
and, hugging it, crept on her outward 
way. There was now only
one danger to come, before her
final effort. The great shelf of rock
inside the Ship's Starn was only
saved from exposure by its rise on
the outer side; but here, happily,
the waves did not break ; they
swept under the overhanging slope
on the outer side, and then passed
on their way; the vast depth of the


 85
water outside was their protection
within. Now and then a wave broke
on the edge of the Ship's Starn, and
then a great wall of green water rose
and rushed down the steep slope, but
in the pause between Maggie passed
along; and now the boat nestled on
the black water, under the shelter
of the very outermost wall of rock.
The Ship's Starn was now her last
refuge. As she hurriedly began to
get the sail ready, she could hear
the whistling of the wind round the
outer side of the rock and overhead.
The black water underneath her rose
and fell, but in some mysterious eddy
or back-water of Nature's forces she
rested in comparative calm on the
very edge of the maelstrom. By
contrast with the darkness of the
Watter's Mou' between the towering 
walls of rock, the sea had some


86 
mysterious light of its own, and just
outside the opening on the western
side she could see the white water
pouring over the sunken rocks as
the passing waves exposed them,
till once more they looked like
teeth in the jaws of the hungry sea.
And now came the final struggle
in her effort to get out to open water. 
The moment she should pass
beyond the shelter of the Ship's
Starn the easterly gale would in all
probability drive her straight upon
the outer reef of rocks among those
angry jaws, where the white teeth
would in an instant grind her and
her boat to nothingness. But if she
should pass this last danger she
should be out in the open Sea, and
might make her way to save her
father. She held in her mind the
spot whence she had seen the answering


 87
signal to the rockets, and
felt a blind trust that God would
help her in her difficulty. Was
not God pleased with self-sacrifice P
What could be better for a maid
than to save her father from accomplished 
sin and the discovery
which made sin so bitter to bear 
“Greater love hath no man than
this, that a man should give up his
life for his friend.” Besides, there
was Sailor Willy Had not he - even he - 
doubted her? And might
she not by this wild night's work win
back her old place in his heart and
his faith? Strong in this new hope,
she made careful preparation for her
great effort. She threw overboard
the spar and got ready the tiller.
Then, having put the sheet round
the thwart on the starboard side,
and laid the loose end where she


88
could grasp it while holding the
tiller, she hoisted the sail and belayed 
the rope that held it. In the
eddy of the storm behind the sheltered 
rock the sail hung idly for a
few seconds, and in this time she
jumped to the stern and held the
tiller with one hand and with the
other drew the sheet of the sail taut
and belayed it. An instant after
the sail caught a gust of wind, and
the boat sprang, as though a living
thing, out toward the channel. The
instant the shelter was past the sail
caught the full sweep of the easterly 
gale, and the boat would have
turned over only for the strain from
the floating spar - line, which now did
its part well. The bow was thrown
round toward the wind, and the boat
began rushing through the water at
a terrific pace. Maggie felt the


89
coldness of death in her heart; but
in that wild moment the bravery of
her nature came out. She shut her
teeth and jammed the tiller down
hard, keeping it in place against her
thigh, with the other leg pressed like
a pillar against the side of the boat.
The little craft seemed sweeping
right down on the outer rocks; already 
she could see the white wall
of water, articulated into white lines
like giant hairs, rushing after the retreating 
waves; and a great despair
swept over her. But at that moment 
the rocks on the western side
of the Watter's Mou' opened so far
that she caught a glimpse of Sailor
Willy's lamp reflected through the
window of the coast-guard hut.
This gave her new hope, and with
a mighty effort she pressed the
tiller harder. The boat sank in the


90 
trough of the waves, rose again;
the spar caught the rush of the
receding wave and pulled the boat's
head a point round, and then the
outer rock was passed: the boat,
actually touching the rock so that
the limpets scraped her side, ran
free in the stormy waves beyond.
Maggie breathed a prayer as with
trembling hand she unloosed the
rope of the floating spar; then, having 
loosened the sheet, she turned
the boat's head south, and, tacking,
ran out in the direction where she
had seen the signal - light of her
father's boat.
By contrast with the terrible turmoil 
amid the rocks, the great waves
of the open sea were safety itself.
No one to whom the sea is an Occupation 
ever fears it in the open;
and this fisher's daughter, with the


 91
Viking blood in her veins, actually
rejoiced as the cockle-shell of a
boat, dipping and jerking like an
angry horse, drove up and down
the swell of the waves. She was a
good way out now, and the whole
coast-line east and west was opening 
up to her. The mist had gone
by, or, if it lasted, hung amid the
rocks inshore; and through the
great blackness round she saw the
lights in the windows of the Castle,
the glimmering lights of the village
of Cruden, and far off the powerful
light at Girdleness blazing out at
intervals. But there was one light
on which her eyes lingered fixedly
—the dim window of the coastguard's 
shelter, where she knew that
her lover kept his grim watch. Her
heart was filled with gladness as she
thought that by what she was doing



92 
she would keep pain and trouble
from him. She knew now, what
she had all along in her heart believed, 
that Sailor Willy would not
flinch from any duty, however stern
and pain-laden to him it might be;
and she knew, too, that neither her
rugged father nor her passionate
young brother would ever forgive
him for, that duty. But now she
would not, could not, think of failing, 
but gripped the tiller hard, and
with set teeth and fixed eyes held
on her perilous way.
Time went by hour by hour; but
so great was her anxiety that she
never noted how it went, but held
on her course, tacking again and
again as she tried to beat her way
to her father through the storm.
The eyes of sea-folk are not ordinary 
eyes — they can pierce the darkness



93
wherein the vision of land-folk
becomes lost or arrested; and the
sea, and the sky over it, and the
coast-line, however black and dim
— however low-lying or distant —
have lessons of their own. Maggie
began by Some mysterious instinct
to find her way where she wanted
to go, till little by little the coastline, 
save for the distant lights of
Girdleness and Boddam, faded out
of sight. Lying as she was on the
very surface of the water, she had
the horizon rising, as it were, around
her, and there is nearly always some
slight sign of light somewhere on
the horizon's rim. There came now
and again rents in the thick clouding 
of the stormy sky, and at such
moments here and there came
patches of lesser darkness, like
oases of light in the desert of the


94 
ebon sea. At one such moment
she saw, far off to the port side,
the outline of a vessel well known
on the coast — the revenue cutter
which was the seaward arm of the
preventive service. And then a
great fear came over poor Maggie's 
heart: the sea was no longer
the open sea, for her father was
held in the toils of his enemies, and
escape seaward became difficult, or
would be almost impossible, when
the coming morn would reveal all
the mysteries that the darkness hid.
Despair, however, has its own courage, 
and Maggie was too far in her
venture now to dread for more than
a passing moment anything which
might follow. She knew that the
“Sea Gull” lay still to the front,
and with a beating heart, and a
brain that throbbed with the eagerness


95
of hope and fear, she held on
her course. The break in the sky
which had shown her the revenue
cutter was only momentary, and all
was again swallowed up in the
darkness; but she feared that some
other such rent in the cloudy night
might expose her father to his
enemies. Every moment, therefore, 
became precious, and steeling
her heart, and drawing the sheet
of her sail as tight as she dared,
she sped on into the darkness—on
for a time that seemed interminable
agony.
Suddenly something black loomed
up ahead of her, thrown out against
the light of the horizon's rim, and
her heart gave a great jump, for
something told her that the Powers
which aid the good wishes of daughters 
had sent her father out of that


96 
wilderness of stormy sea. With her
sea-trained eyes she knew in a few
moments that the boat pitching so
heavily was indeed the “Sea Gull.”
At the same moment some one on
the boat's deck saw her sail, and a
hoarse muffled murmur of voices
came to her over the waves in the
gale. The coble's head was thrown
round to the wind, and in that stress
of storm and chopping sea she beat
and buffeted, and like magic her way
stopped, and she lay tossing. Maggie 
realized the intention of the manoeuver, 
and deftly swung her boat
round till she came under the starboard 
quarter of the fishing - boat,
and in the shadow of her greater
bulk and vaster sail, reefed though
it was, found a comparative calm.
Then she called out:
“Father! It's me–Maggie! Dinna


 97
show a licht, but try to throw me
a rope.”
With a shout in which were mingled 
many strong feelings, her father
leaned over the bulwark, and, with
seaman's instinct of instant action,
threw her a rope. She deftly caught
it, and, making it fast to the bows
of her boat, dropped her sail. Then
some one threw her another rope,
which she fastened round her waist.
She threw herself into the sea, and,
holding tight to the rope, was shortly 
pulled breathless on board the
“Sea Gull.”
She was instantly the center of a
ring of men. Not only were her
father and two brothers on board,
but there were no less than six men,
Seemingly foreigners, in the group.
“Maggie I" said her father. “In
God's name, lass, hoo cam ye oot



98 
here? Were ye overta'en by the
storm ? God be thankit that ye
met us, for this is a wild nicht to
be oot on the North Sea by yer
lanes.”
“Father!" said she, in a hurried
whisper in his ear, “I must speak
wi' ye alane. There is no a mo-
ment to lose !”
“Speak on, lass.”
“No before these strangers, father.
I must speak alane !” Without a
word, MacWhirter took his daughter 
aside, and, amid a muttered dissatisfaction
 of the strange men,
signed to her to proceed. Then,
as briefly as she could, Maggie told
her father that it was known that a
cargo was to be run that night, that
the coast-guard all along Buchan
had been warned, and that she had
come out to tell him of his danger.


 99
As she spoke the old man
groaned, and after a pause said:
“I maun tell the rest: I'm no
the master here the noo. Mendoza
has me in his grip, an' his men rule
here !”
“But, father, the boat is yours,
and the risk is yours. It is you'll
be punished if there is a discovery !”
“That may be, lass, but I'm no
free.”
“I feared it was true, father, but I
thocht it my duty to come.” Doubtless 
the old man knew that Maggie
would understand fully what he
meant, but the only recognition he
made of her act of heroism was to
lay his hand heavily on her shoulder. 
Then, stepping forward, he
called the men round him, and in
his own rough way told them of the


10O 
danger. The strangers muttered and
scowled; but Andrew and Neil drew
close to their sister, and the younger
man put his arm around her and
pressed her to him. Maggie felt
the comfort of the kindness, and,
laying her head on her brother's
shoulder, cried quietly in the darkness. 
It was a relief to her pent-up
feelings to be able to give way, if
only so far. When MacWhirter
brought his tale to a close, and
asked, “And now, lads, what's to
be done P” one of the strangers, a
brawny, heavily built man, spoke
out harshly:
“But for why this? Was it not
that this woman's lover was of the
guard 2 In this affairs the women
must do their best too. This lover
of the guard—" He was hotly interrupted 
by Niel:


 101
“'Tis no the part of Maggie to
tak a hand in this at a'.”
“But I say it is the part of all.
When Mendoza bought this man
he bought all—unless there be traitors 
in his house !” This roused
Maggie, who spoke out quickly, for
she feared that her brother's passion
might brew trouble:
“I hae nae part in this dreadfu'
affair. It is no by ma wish or ma
aid that father has embarked in this
—this enterprise. I hae naught to
dae wi't o' ony kind.”
“Then for why are you here P”
asked the burly man, with a coarse
laugh.
“Because ma father and ma
brithers are in danger—danger into
which they hae been led, or been
forced, by ye and the like o' ye.
Do ye think it was for pleasure, or,


102 
O my God! for profit either, that I
cam oot this nicht—an' in that P”
and as she spoke she pointed to
where the little boat strained madly
at the rope which held her. Then
MacWhirter spoke out fiercely, so
fiercely that the lesser spirits who
opposed him were cowed:
“Leave the lass alane, I say!
Yon's nane o' her doin’; an' if ye
be men ye’d honor her that cam oot
in sic a tempest for the sake o' the
likes o' me—o' us !”
But when the strangers were silent, 
Niel, whose passion had been
aroused, could not be quieted, and
spoke out with a growing fury
which seemed to choke him :
“So Sailor Willy told ye the
danger and then let ye come oot in
this nicht ! He'll hae tae reckon
wi' me for that when we get in.”


103
“He telt me naethin'. I saw
Bella Cruickshank gie him the telegram, 
and I guessed. He doesna
ken I'm here—and he maun never 
ken. Nane must ever ken
that a warnin' cam the nicht to
father 1"
“But they'll watch for us comin'
in.”
“We maun rin back to Cuxhaven,” 
said the quiet voice of Andrew,
who had not yet spoken.
“But ye canna,” said Maggie;
“the revenue cutter is on the watch,
and when the mornin' comes will
follow ye; and besides, hoo can ye
get to Cuxhaven in this wind?”
“Then what are we tae dae,
lass P” said her father.
* Dae, father? Dae what ye
should dae—throw a' this poisonous 
stuff that has brought this ruin


104
overboard. Lichten yer boat, as ye
will lichten yer conscience, and
come hame as ye went oot!”
The burly man swore a great
oath :
“Nothing overboard shall be
thrown. These belongs not to
you, but to Mendoza. If they be
touched he closes on your boat,
and ruin it is for you!" Maggie
saw her father hesitate, and feared
that other counsels might prevail;
so she spoke out as by an inspiration. 
There, amid the surges of the
perilous seas, the daughter's heroic
devotion and her passionate earnestness 
made a new calm in her
father's life:
“Father, dinna be deceived. Wi’
this wind on shore an' the revenue
cutter outside an' the dawn no far
off, ye canna escape. Noo in the


 105
darkness ye can get rid o' the danger. 
Dinna lose a moment. The
storm is somewhat lesser just enoo.
Throw all owerboard and come
back to yer old self! What if we
be ruined P. We can wark; an we
shall a’ be happy yet !”
Something seemed to rise in the
old man's heart and give him
strength. Without pause he said,
with a grand simplicity:
“Ye're reet, lass, ye're reet !
Haud up the casks, men, and stave
them in !"
Andrew and Niel rushed to his
bidding. Mendoza's men protested,
but were afraid to interfere, and,
one after another, bales and casks
were lifted on deck. The bales
were tossed overboard, and the
heads of the casks stove in till the
scuppers were alternately drenched


106
with brandy and washed with the
SeaS.
In the midst of this, Maggie,
knowing that if all were to be of
any use she must be found at home
in the morning, quietly pulled her
boat as close as she dared, and, slipping 
down the rope, managed to
clamber into it. Then she loosed
the painter; and the wind and
waves took her each instant farther
and farther away.
The sky over the horizon was
brightening every instant, and there
was a wild fear in her heart which
not even the dull thud of the hammers 
as the casks were staved in
could allay. She felt that it was a
race against time, and her overexcited 
imagination multiplied her
natural fear. Her boat's head was
to home, steering for where she


107
guessed was the dim light on
the cliff, toward which her
heart yearned. She hauled the
sheets close — as close as she dared - 
for now speed was everything if she
was to get back unseen. Well she
knew that Sailor Willy on his
lonely vigil would be true to his
trust, and that his eagle eye could
not fail to note her entry when once
the day had broken. In a fever
of anxiety she kept her eye on the
Girdleness light, by which she had
to steer, and with the rise and
fall of every wave, as she swept by
it, threw the boat's head a point to
the wind and let it fall away again.
The storm had nearly spent itself, 
but there were still angry moments 
when the mist was swept in
masses before fresh gusts. These,
however, were fewer and fewer, and



108
in a little while she ceased to heed
them or even to look for them, and
at last her eager eye began to discern 
through the storm the flickering 
lights of the little port. There
came a moment when the tempest
poured out the lees of its wrath in
one final burst of energy, which
wrapped the flying boat in a wraith
of mist.
And then the tempest swept onward, 
shoreward, with the broken
mist showing white in the springing 
dawn, like the wings of some
messenger of coming peace.


IV.
MATTERS looked serious enough
on the “Sea Gull” when the time
came in which rather the darkness
began to disappear than the light to
appear. Night and day have their
own mysteries, and their nascency
is as distant and as mysterious as
the origin of life. The sky and the
waters still seemed black, and the
circle in which the little craft lived
was as narrow as ever; but here
and there in sky and on sea were
faint streaks perceptible rather than
distinguishable, as though swept
thither by the trumpet-blast of the




110
messenger of the dawn. Mendoza's
men did not stint their curses nor
their threats, and Niel, with passionate 
violence, so assailed them in return 
that both MacWhirter and Andrew 
had to exercise their powers of
restraint. But blood is hot, and the
lives of lawless men are prone to
make violence a habit ; the two
elder men were anxious that there
should be no extension of the present 
bitter bickering. As for MacWhirter, 
his mind was in a whirl
and tumult of mixed emotions.
First came his anxiety for Maggie
when she had set forth alone on
the stormy sea with such inadequate 
equipment. Well the old
fisherman knew the perils that lay
before her in her effort to win the
shore, and his heart was positively
sick with anxiety when every effort


111
of thought or imagination concerning 
her ended in something like despair. 
In one way he was happier
than he had been for many months;
the impending blow had fallen, and
though he was ruined, it had come
in such a time that his criminal intent 
had not been accomplished.
Here again his anxiety regarding
Maggie became intensified, for was
it not to save him that she had set
forth on her desperate enterprise ?
He groaned aloud as he thought of
the price that he might yet have to
pay—that he might have paid already, 
though he knew it not as yet
—for the service which had saved
him from the after consequences of
his sin. He dared not think more
on the subject, for it would, he
feared, madden him ; and he must
have other work to engross his



112 
thoughts. Thus it was that the
danger of collision between Niel
and Mendoza's men became an
anodyne to his pain. He knew
that a quarrel among Seamen, and
under such conditions, would be no
idle thing, for they had all their
knives, and with such hot blood on
all sides none would hesitate to use
them. The whole of the smuggled
goods had by now been thrown
overboard, the tobacco having gone
the last, the bales having been
broken up. So heavy had been the
cargo that there was a new danger
in that the boat was too much lightened. 
As Mendoza had intended
that force as well as fraud was to
aid this venture, he had not stuck
at trifles. There was no pretense
of concealment, and even the ballast 
had made way for cask and box



113
and bale. The “Sea Gull” had
been only partially loaded at Hamburg, 
but when out of sight of port
her cargo had been completed from
other boats which had followed, till,
when she started for Buchan, she
was almost a solid mass of contraband 
goods. Mendoza's men felt
desperate at this hopeless failure of
the venture; and as Niel, too, was
desperate, in a different way, there
was a grim possibility of trouble on
board at any minute.
The coming of the dawn was
therefore a welcome relief, for it
united—if only for a time — all on
board to try to avert a common
danger.
Lighter and lighter grew the expanse 
of sea and sky, until over the
universe seemed to spread a cool,
pearly gray, against which every


114
object seemed to stand starkly out.
The smugglers were keenly on the
watch, and they saw, growing more
clearly each instant out of the darkness, 
the black, low-lying hull, short
funnel, and tapering spars of the
revenue cutter about three or four
miles off the starboard quarter. The
preventive men seemed to see them
at the same time, for there was a
manifest stir on board, and the cutter's 
head was changed. Then MacWhirter 
knew it was necessary to
take some bold course of action, for
the “Sea Gull” lay between two
fires; and he made up his mind to
run then and there for Port Erroll.
As the “Sea Gull” drew nearer
in to shore the waves became more
turbulent, for there is ever a more
ordered succession in deep waters
than where the onward rush is


 115
broken by the undulations of the
shore. Minute by minute the dawn
was growing brighter and the shore
was opening up. The “Sea Gull,”
lightened of her load, could not
with safety be thrown across the
wind, and so the difficulty of her
tacks was increased. The dawn was
just shooting its first rays over the
eastern sea when the final effort
to win the little port came to be
made.
The harbor of Port Erroll is a
tiny haven of refuge won from the
jagged rocks that bound the eastern
side of Cruden Bay. It is sheltered
on the northern side by the cliff
which runs as far as the Watter's
Mou', and separated from the mouth
of the Water of Cruden, with its
waste of shifting sands, by a high
wall of concrete. The harbor faces


116
east, and its first basin is the smaller
of the two, the larger opening sharply 
to the left a little way in. At the
best of times it is not an easy matter
to gain the harbor, for only when
the tide has fairly risen is it available 
at all, and the rapid tide which
runs up from the Scaurs makes in
itself a difficulty at such times. The
tide was now at three-quarters flood,
so that in as far as water was concerned 
there was no difficulty; but
the fierceness of the waves, which
sent up a wall of white water all
along the cliffs, looked ominous
indeed.
As the “Sea Gull” drew nearer
to the shore considerable commotion 
was caused on both sea and
land. The revenue cutter dared not
approach so close to the shore,
studded as it was with sunken

 117
rocks, as did the lighter-drafted
coble ; but her commander evidently 
did not mean to let this be
to the advantage of the smuggler.
A gun was fired to attract the authorities 
on shore, and signals were
got ready to hoist.
The crowd of strangers who
thronged the little port had instinctively 
hidden themselves behind 
rock and wall and boat as
the revelation of the dawn came
upon them, so that the whole place
presented the appearance of a warren 
when the rabbits are beginning
to emerge after a temporary scare.
There were not wanting, however,
many who stood out in the open,
affecting, with what nonchalance
they could, a simple business interest 
at the little port. Sailor Willy
was on the cliff between the guardhouse


118
and the Watter's Mou', where
he had kept his vigil all the night
long. As soon as possible after he
had sent out his appeal for help the
lieutenant had come over from Collieston 
with a boatman and three
men, and these were now down on
the quay waiting for the coming of
the “Sea Gull.” When he had arrived, 
and had learned the state of
things, the lieutenant, who knew of
Willy Barrow's relations with the
daughter of the suspected man, had
kindly ordered him to watch the
cliff, while he himself, with the men,
would look after the port. When
he had first given the order in the
presence of the other coast-guards,
Willy had instinctively drawn himself 
up, as though he felt that he,
too, had come under suspicion; so
the lieutenant took the earliest opportunity


119
when they were alone of
saying to Willy:
“Barrow, I have arranged your
duties as I have done not by any
means because I suspect that you
would be drawn by your sympathies 
into any neglect of duty — I
know you too well for that—but
simply because I want to spare you
pain in case things may be as we
suspect.”
Willy saluted, and thanked him
with his eyes, as he turned away,
for he feared that the fullness of his
heart might betray him. The poor
fellow was much overwrought. All
night long he had paced the cliffs
in the dull routine of his duty, with
his heart feeling like a lump of
lead, and his brain on fire with
fear. He knew from the wildness
of Maggie's rush away from him


12O 
that she was bent on some desperate 
enterprise, and as he had no
clue to her definite intentions, he
could only imagine. He thought
and thought until his brain almost
began to reel with the intensity of
his mental effort; and as he was so
placed, tied to the stake of his duty,
that he could speak with no one on
the subject, he had to endure alone
and in doubt the darkness of his
soul, tortured alike by hopes and
fears, through all the long night.
At last, however, the pain exhausted 
itself, and doubt became its
own anodyne. Despair has its
calms—the back-waters of fears - 
where the tired imagination may
rest awhile before the strife begins
anew.
With joy he saw that the storm
was slackening with the coming of


121
the dawn; and when the last fierce
gust had swept by him, screaming
through the rigging of the flagstaff
overhead, and sweeping inland the
broken fragments of the mist, he
turned to the sea, now of a cool
gray with the light of the coming
dawn, and swept it far and wide
with his glass. With gladness —
and yet with an ache in his heart
which he could not understand — he
realized that there was in sight only
one coble, the “Sea Gull”— he
knew her well—running for the
port, and farther out the hull and
smoke, the light spars and swift
lines of the revenue cutter, which
was evidently following her. He
strolled with the appearance of leisureliness — 
though his heart was
throbbingm— toward the cliff right
over the little harbor, so that he


122
could look down and see from close
quarters all that went on. He
could not but note the many
strangers dispersed about, all within
easy distance of a rush to the quay
when the boat should land, or the
way in which the lieutenant and his
men seemed to keep guard over the
whole place. At first the figures,
the walls of the port, the cranes, the
boats, and the distant headlands
were silhouetted in black against
the background of gray Sea and
gray sky; but as the dawn came
closer each object began to stand
out in its natural proportions. All
kept growing clearer and yet
clearer, and more and more thoroughly 
outlined, till the moment
came when the sun, shooting over
the horizon, set every living thing
whose eyes had been regulated to


123
the strain of the darkness and the
twilight blinking and winking in
the glory of the full light of day.
Eagerly he searched the faces of
the crowd with his glass for Maggie, 
but he could not see her anywhere, 
and his heart seemed to sink
within him, for well he knew that
it must be no ordinary cause which
kept Maggie from being one of the
earliest on the lookout for her father. 
Closer and closer came the
“Sea Gull,” running for the port
with a speed and recklessness that
set both the smugglers and the preventive 
men all agog. Such haste
and such indifference to danger
sprang, they felt, from no common
cause; and they all came to the conclusion 
that the boat, delayed by the
storm, discovered by the daylight,
and cut off by the revenue cutter, was



124 
making a desperate push for success
in her hazard. And so all, watchers
and watched, braced themselves for
what might come about. Among
the groups moved the tall figure of
Mendoza, whispering and pointing,
but keeping carefully hidden from
the sight of the coast-guards. He
was evidently inciting them to some
course from which they held back.
Closer and closer came the “Sea
Gull,” lying down to the scuppers
as she tacked; lightened as she was
she made more leeway than was
usual to so crank a boat. At last
she got her head in the right direction 
for a run in, and to the amazement 
of all who saw her, came full
tilt into the outer basin, and turning 
sharply round, ran into the
inner basin under bare poles.
There was not one present, smuggler


125
or coast-guard, who did not
Set down the daring attempt as
simply suicidal. In a few seconds
the boat stuck on the sand-bank
accumulated at the western end of
the basin, and stopped, her bows
almost touching the side of the
pier. The coast-guards had not expected 
any such manoeuver, and
had taken their place on either side
of the entrance to the inner basin,
so that it took them a few seconds
to run the length of the pier and
come opposite the boat. The
crowd of the smugglers and the
smugglers' friends was so great
that, just as Niel and his brother 
began to shove out a plank
from the bows to step ashore,
there was so thick a cluster round
the spot that the lieutenant, as he
came, could not see what was going
9


126 
on. Some little opposition was
made to his passing through the
mass of people, which was getting
closer every instant; but his men
closed up behind, and together
they forced a way to the front before 
any one from the “Sea Gull”
could spring on shore. A sort of
angry murmur — that deep undertone 
which marks the passion of a
mass — arose, and the lieutenant,
recognizing its import, faced round
like lightning, his revolver pointed
straight in the faces of the crowd,
while the men with him drew their
cutlasses.
To Sailor Willy this appearance
of action gave a relief from almost
intolerable pain. He was in feverish 
anxiety about Maggie, but he
could do nothing—nothing; and
to an active and resolute man this


 127
feeling is in itself the worst of pain.
His heart was simply breaking with
suspense, and so it was that the
sight of drawn weapons, in whatever 
cause, came like an anodyne
to his tortured imagination. The
flash of the cutlasses woke in him
the instinct of action, and with a
leaping heart he sprang down the
narrow winding path that led to
the quay.
Before the lieutenant's pistol the
crowd fell back. It was not that
they were afraid — for cowardice is
pretty well unknown in Buchan —
but authority, and especially in
arms, has a special force with lawbreakers. 
But the smugglers did
not mean going back altogether
now that their booty was so close
to them, and the two bodies stood
facing each other, when Sailor


128
Willy came upon the scene and
stood beside the officers. Things
were looking pretty serious, when
the resonant voice of MacWhirter
was heard:
“What d'ye mean, men, crowdin'
on the officers P Stand back there,
and let the coast-guards come
aboard an they will. There's
naught here that they mayn't
see.”
The lieutenant turned and stepped
on the plank—which Niel had by
this time shoved on shore — and
went on board, followed by two of
his men, the other remaining with
the boatman and Willy Barrow on
the quay. Niel went straight to
the officer, and said:
“I want to go ashore at once.
Search me an ye will !” He spoke
so rudely that the officer was angered,


129
and said to one of the men
beside him : -
“Put your hands over him and
let him go," adding, sotto voce, “He
wants a lesson in manners.” The
man lightly passed his hands over
him to see that he had nothing contraband 
about him, and being satisfied 
on the point, stood back and
nodded to his officer, and Niel
sprang ashore and hurried off toward 
the village.
Willy had, by this time, a certain
feeling of relief; for he had been
thinking, and he knew that MacWhirter 
would not have been so
ready to bring the coast-guards on
board if he had any contraband
with him. Hope did for him what
despair could not, for as he instinctively 
turned his eyes over the waste
of angry Sea, for an instant he did


130
not know if it were the blood in his
eyes, or, in reality, the red of the
dawn, which had shot up over the
eastern horizon.
Mendoza's men, having been
carefully searched by one of the
coast-guards, came sullenly on shore
and went to the back of the crowd,
where their master, scowling and
white-faced, began eagerly to talk
with them in whispers. MacWhirter 
and his elder son busied them-
selves, with apparent nonchalance,
in the needful matters of the landing, 
and the crowd seemed holding
back for a spring. The suspense of
all was broken by the incoming of
a boat sent off from the revenue
cutter, which, driven by four sturdy
oarsmen, and steered by the commander 
himself, swept into the
outer basin of the harbor, tossing



 131
among the broken waves. In the
comparative shelter of the wall it
turned, and driving into the inner
basin, pulled up on the slip beyond
where the “Sea Gull” lay. The instant 
the boat touched, six blue-jackets 
sprang ashore, followed by
the commander, and all seven men
marched quietly, but resolutely, to
the quay opposite the “Sea Gull's”
bow. The oarsmen followed, when
they had hauled their boat up on
the slip. The crowd now abandoned 
whatever had been its intention, 
and fell back, looking and
muttering thunder.
By this time the lieutenant was
satisfied that the coble contained
nothing that was contraband, and,
telling its master so, stepped on
shore just as Niel, with his face
white as a sheet and his eyes blazing,



132 
rushed back at full speed. He
immediately attacked Sailor Willy:
“What hae ye done wi' ma sister
Maggie P”
He aswered as quietly as he
could, although there shot through
his heart a new pain, a new anxiety:
“I know naught of her. I haven't
seen her since last night, when Alice
MacDonald was being married. Is
she not at home P”
“Don’t ye know damned weel
that she's not? Why did ye send
her oot ?” and he looked at him
with the menace of murder in his
eyes. The lieutenant saw from the
looks of the two men that something 
was wrong, and asked Niel,
shortly : -
“Where did you see her last?”
Niel was going to make some angry
reply; but in an instant Mendoza


133
stepped forward, and in a loud voice
gave instruction to one of his men
who had been on board the “Sea
Gull" to take charge of her, as she
was his under a bill of sale. This
gave Niel time to think, and his
answer came sullenly:
“Nane o' yer business — mind yer
ain affairs | " MacWhirter, when he
had seen Niel come running back,
had realized the worst, and leaned
on the taffrail of the boat, groaning. 
Mendoza's man sprang on
board, and, taking him roughly by
the shoulder, said:
“Come, clear out here ! This
boat is to Mendoza; get away !”
The old man was so overcome with
his feelings regarding Maggie that
he made no reply, but quietly, with
bent form, stepped on the plank and
gained the quay. Willy Barrow


134 
rushed forward and took him by the
hand, and whispered to him:
“What does he mean P”
“He means,” said the old man, in
a low, strained voice, “that for me
an' him, an' tae warn us, she cam
oot last nicht in the storm in a wee
bit boat, an' that she is no to her
hame!” and he groaned. Willy was
smitten with horror. This, then, was
Maggie's high and desperate purpose 
when she left him. He knew
now the meaning of those despairing words, 
and the darkness of the
grave seemed to close over his soul.
He moaned out to the old man:
“She did not tell me she was going. 
I never knew it. O my God!”
The old man, with the protective instinct 
of the old to the young, laid
his hand on his shoulder, as he said
to him, in a broken voice:


135
“A ken it, lad! A ken it weel !
She tellt me so hersel'. The sin is
a' wi' me, though you, puir lad, must
e'en bear yer share o' the pain!”
The commander said quietly to the
lieutenant:
“Looks queer, don't it — the coast-guard 
and the smuggler whispering?”
“All right,” came the answer. “I
know Barrow; he is as true as steel,
but he's engaged to the old man's
daughter. But I gather there's
something queer going on this
morning about her. I'll find out.
Barrow,” he added, calling Willy to
him, “what is it about MacWhirter's
daughter?”
“I don't know for certain, sir; but
I fear she was out at sea last night.”
“At sea!” broke in the commander; 
“at sea last night—how P”


136
“She was in a bit fishin'-boat,”
broke in MacWhirter. “Neighbors, 
hae ony o' ye seen her this.
mornin'? 'Twas my son Andra's
boat, that he keeps i' the Downans”
— another name for the Watter's
Mou'. A sad silence, that left the
angry roar of the waves as they
broke on the rocks and on the
long strand in full possession, was
the only reply.
“Is the boat back in the Watter's 
Mou'?” asked the lieutenant,
sharply.
“No,” said a fisherman. “A cam
up just noo past the Barley-mill, and
there's nae boat there.”
“Then God help her, and God
forgie me !” said MacWhirter, tearing 
off his cap and holding up his
hands, “for A've killed her—her
that so loved her auld father that


137
she went oot alane in a bit boat in
the storm i' the nicht to save him
frae the consequence o' his sin.”
Willy Barrow groaned, and the lieutenant 
turned to him :
“Heart, man, heart! God won't
let a brave girl like that be lost.
That's the lass for a sailor's wife
'Twill be all right—you'll be proud
of her yet !”
But Sailor Willy only groaned,
despite the approval of his conscience; 
his words of last night
came back to him : “You are no
fit wife for me !” Now the commander 
spoke out to MacWhirter:
“When did you see her last?”
“Aboot twa o'clock i' the mornin’.”
“Where P’”
“Aboot twenty miles off the
Scaurs.”


138 
“How did she come to leave
you?”
“She pulled the boat that she
cam in alongside the coble, and got
in by hersel'. The last I saw o' her
she had hoisted her sail and was
running nor'west. . . . But A’ll see
her nae mair—a's ower wi' the puir,
brave lass, and wi' me, tae, that killed
her—a's ower the noo—a's ower "
and he covered his face with his
hands and sobbed. The commander
said, kindly enough, but with a stern
gravity that there was no mistaking:
“Do I take it rightly that the
girl went out in the storm to warn
you?”
“Aye! Puir lass, 'twas an ill day
that made me put sic a task on her
— God forgie me!” and there and
then he told them all of her gallant
deed.


139
The commander turned to the
lieutenant, and spoke in the quick,
resolute, masterful accents of habitual 
command:
“I shall leave you the blue-jackets 
to help. Send your men all out,
and scour every nook and inlet
from Kirkton to Boddam. Out
with all the life-boats on the coast !
And you men "–he turned to the
crowd—“turn out, all of you, to
help ! Show that there's some
man's blood in you, to atone, if you
can, for the wrong that sent this
young girl out in a storm to save
her father from you and your
like " Here he turned again to
the lieutenant: “Keep a sharp
eye on that man, Mendoza, and
all his belongings. We'll attend to
him later on : I’ll be back before
night.”


140
“Where are you off to, Commander P”
“I’m going to scour the sea in
the track of the storm where that
gallant lass went last night. A
brave girl that dared what she did
for her father's sake is not to be
lost without an effort; and, by God,
she sha'n't lack it while I hold Her
Majesty's command l Boatswain,
signal the cutter full steam up — no,
you! We mustn't lose time, and
the boatswain comes with me. To
your oars, men!”
The seamen gave a quick, sharp
“Hurrah!" as they sprang to their
places, while the man of the shore
party to whom the order had been
given climbed the sea-wall and telegraphed 
the needful orders. The
crowd seemed to catch the enthusiasm 
of the moment and scattered


141
right and left to make search
along the shore. In a few seconds
the revenue boat was tossing on the
waves outside the harbor, the men
laying to their work as they drove
her along, their bending oars keeping 
time to the swaying body of the
commander, who had himself taken
the tiller.
The lieutenant said to Willy,
with thoughtful kindness:
“Where would you like to work
on the search P Choose which part
you will.” Willy instinctively
touched his cap as he answered
sadly:
“I should like to watch here, sir,
if I may. She would make straight
for the Watter's Mou’l”



V.
THE search for the missing girl
was begun vigorously, and carried
on thoroughly and with untiring energy. 
The Port Erroll life-boat
was got out and proceeded up coast,
and a telegram was sent to Kirkton
to get out the life-boat there and
follow up the shore to Port Erroll.
From either place a body of men
with ropes followed on shore, keeping 
pace with the boats' progress.
In the meantime the men of each
village and hamlet all along the
shore of Buchan from Kirkton
to Boddam began a systematic exploration



143
of all the openings on the
coast. Of course there were some
places where no search could at
present be made. The Bullers, for
instance, was well justifying its
name, with the wild turmoil of
waters that fretted and churned between 
its rocky walls; and the
neighborhood of the Twa Een was
like a seething caldron. At Dunbuy 
a great sheet of foam, perpetually 
renewed by the rush and recoil 
of the waves among the rocks,
lay like a great white blanket over
the inlet, and effectually hid any
flotsam or jetsam that might have
been driven thither. But on the
high cliffs around these places, on
every coign of vantage, sat women
and children, who kept keen watch
for aught that might develop.
Every now and again a shrill cry


144 
would bring a rush to the place,
and eager eyes would follow the
pointing hand of the watcher who
had seen some floating matter; but
in every case a few seconds and a
little dispersing of the shrouding
foam put an end to expectation.
Throughout that day the ardor
of the searchers never abated.
Morning had come rosy and smiling 
over the waste of heaving
waters, and the sun rose and rose
till its noonday rays beat down oppressively. 
But Willy Barrow
never ceased from his lonely vigil
on the cliff. At dinner-time a good-hearted 
woman brought him some
food, and in kindly sympathy sat
by him in silence while he ate it.
At first it seemed to him that to
eat at all was some sort of wrong
to Maggie, and he felt that to at-


 145
tempt it would choke him. But
after a few mouthfuls the human
need in him responded to the occasion, 
and he realized how much he
wanted food. The kindly neighbor
then tried to cheer him with a few
words of hope, and a many words of
Maggie's worth, and left him, if not
cheered, at least sustained for what
he had to endure.
All day long his glass ranged
the sea in endless, ever-baffled hope.
He saw the revenue boat strike
away at first toward Girdleness, and
then turn and go out to where
Maggie had left the “Sea Gull,”
and then under full steam churn
her way northwest through the
fretted seas. Now and again he
Saw boats, far and near, pass on
their way; and as they went
through that wide belt of sea where


146 
Maggie's body might be drifting
with the wreckage of her boat, his
heart leaped and fell again under
stress of hope and despair. The
tide fell lower and ever lower, till
the waves piling into the estuary
roared among the rocks that paved
the Watter's Mou'. Again and
again he peered down from every
rocky point, in fear of seeing amid
the turmoil—what, he feared to
think. There was ever before his
eyes the figure of the woman he
loved, spread out rising and falling
with the heaving waves, her long
hair tossing wide and making an
aureole round the upturned white
face. Turn where he would, in sea
or land, or in the white clouds of
the summer sky, that image was
ever before him, as though it had
in some way burned into his iris.



147
Late in the afternoon, as he stood
beside the crane, where he had met
Maggie the night before, he saw
Niel coming toward him, and instinctively 
moved from the place;
for he felt that he would not like
to meet on that spot—forever to be
hallowed in his mind—Maggie's
brother with hatred in his heart.
So he moved slowly to meet him,
and when he had got close to the
flagstaff waited till he should come
up, and swept once again the wide
horizon with his glass—in vain.
Niel, too, had begun to slow his
steps as he drew nearer. Slower
and slower he came, and at last
stood close to the man whom in
the morning he had spoken to
with hatred and murder in his
heart.
All the morning Niel had



148 
worked with a restless, feverish activity 
which was the wonder of all.
He had not stayed with the searching 
party with whom he had set
out; their exhaustive method was
too slow for him, and he soon distanced 
them, and alone scoured the
whole coast as far as Murdoch
Head. Then, in almost complete
despair—for his mind was satisfied
that Maggie's body had never
reached that part of the shore—
he had retraced his steps almost
at a run, and, skirting the Sands of
Cruden Bay, on whose wide expanse 
the breakers still rolled heavily 
and roared loudly, he glanced
among the jagged rocks that lay
around Whinnyfold and stretched
under the water away to the Scaurs.
Then he came back again, and the
sense of desolation, complete upon


 I49
him, moved his passionate heart to
sympathy and pity. It is when the
soul within us feels the narrow environments 
of our selfishness that
she really begins to spread her
wings.
Niel walked over the sand-hills
along Cruden Bay like a man in a
dream. With a sailor's habit he
watched the sea, and now and again
had his attention attracted by the
drifting masses of seaweed torn
from its rocky bed by the storm.
In such tossing black masses he
sometimes thought that Maggie's
body might lie; but his instinct of
the sea was too true to be long deceived. 
And then he began to take
himself to task. Hitherto he had
been too blindly passionate to be
able to think of anything but his
own trouble; but now, despite what


150
he could do, the woe-stricken face
of Sailor Willy would rise before
his inner eye like the embodiment
or the wraith of a troubled conscience. 
When once this train of
argument had been started, the remorseless 
logic which is the mech-
anism of the spirit of conscience
went on its way unerringly. Well
he knew it was the ill-doing of
which he had a share, and not the
duty which Willy owed, that took
his sister out alone on the stormy
sea. He knew from her own lips
that Willy had neither sent her nor
even knew of her going, and the
habit of fair play which belonged
to his life began to exert an influence. 
The first sign of his change
of mind was the tear which welled
up in his eye and rolled down his
cheek. “Poor Maggie Poor


 151
Willy 1” he murmured to himself,
half unconsciously. “A'll gang tae
him an' tak it a' back!” With this
impulse on him he quickened his
steps, and never paused till he saw
Willy Barrow before him, spy-glass
to eye, searching the sea for any
sign of his lost love. Then his
fears, and the awkwardness which a
man feels at such a moment, no
matter how poignant may be the
grief which underlies it, began to
trip him up. When he stood beside
Willy Barrow, he said, with what
bravery he could :
“A tak it a' back, Sailor Willy
Ye were no tae blame ! It was oor
doin'! Will ye forgie me?” Willy
turned and impulsively grasped the
hand extended to him. In the
midst of his overwhelming pain
this was some little gleam of sunshine.


I52 
He had himself just sufficient 
remorse to make the assurance
by another of his innocence grateful. 
He knew well that if he had
chosen to sacrifice his duty Maggie
would never have gone out to sea,
and though it did not even occur
to him to repent of doing his duty,
the mere temptation — the mere
struggle against it—made a sort of
foothold where flying remorse
might for a moment rest. When
the eyes of the two men met, Willy
felt a new duty rise within him.
He had always loved Niel, who
was younger than himself, and was
Maggie's brother, and he could not
but see the look of anguish in the
eyes that were so like Maggie's. He
saw there something which in one
way transcended his own pain, and
made him glad that he had not on


153
his soul the guilt of treachery to his
duty. Not for the wide world
would he have gazed into Maggie's
eyes with such a look as that in
his own. And yet — and yet — there
came back to him with an overpowering 
flood of anguish the
thought that, though the darkness
had mercifully hidden it, Maggie's
face, after she had tempted him,
had had in it something of the
same expression. It is a part of
the penalty of being human that
we cannot forbid the coming of
thoughts, but it is a glory of humanity 
that we can wrestle with them
and overcome them. Quick on
the harrowing memory of Maggie's
shame came the thought of Maggie's 
heroic self-devotion; her true
spirit had found a way out of
shame and difficulty, and the tribute


154 
of the lieutenant, “That's the
lass for a sailor's wife l" seemed to
ring in Willy's ears. As far as
death was concerned, Willy Barrow 
did not fear it for himself, and
how could he feel the fear for another? 
Such semblance of fear as
had been in his distress was based
on the selfishness which is a part
of man's love, and in this wild hour
of pain and distress became a thing
of naught. All this reasoning, all
this sequence of emotions, passed
in a few seconds, and—as it seemed
to him, all at once — Willy Barrow
broke out crying with the abandon
which marks strong men when
spiritual pain breaks down the barriers 
of their pride. Men of Willy's
class seldom give way to their
emotions. The prose of life is too
continuous to allow of any habit



155
of prolonged emotional indulgence;
the pendulum swings back from
fact to fact, and things go on as
before. So it was with Sailor
Willy. His spasmodic grief was
quick as well as fierce, like an
April shower; and in a few seconds 
he had regained his calm.
But the break, though but momentary, 
had relieved his pent-up feelings, 
and his heart beat more
calmly for it. Then some of the
love which he had for Maggie went
out to her brother, and he saw that
the pain in his face did not lessen,
a great pity overcame him, and he
tried to comfort Niel.
“Don't grieve, man I Don't
grievel I know well you'd give
your heart's blood for Maggie.”
He faltered as he spoke her name,
but with a great gulp went on


156 
bravely: “There's your father — her
father — we must try and comfort
him. Maggie”— here he lifted his
cap reverently—" is with God! We
— you and I, and all — must so bear
ourselves that she shall not have
died in vain.” To Sailor Willy's
tear-blurred eyes, as he looked upward, 
it seemed as if the great
white gull which perched, as he
spoke, on the yard of the flagstaff
over his head was in some way an
embodiment of the spirit of the lost
girl; and, like the lightning phantasmagoria 
of a dream, there flitted
across his mind many an old legend
and eery belief gained among the
wolds and barrows of his Yorkshire
home.
There was not much more to be
said between the men, for they understood 
each other, and men of


157
their class are not prone to speak
more than is required. They walked
northward, and for a long time they
stood together on the edge of the
cliff, now and again gazing Seaward,
and ever and anon to where, below
their feet, the falling tide was fretting 
and churning among the boulders 
at the entrance of the Watter's
Mou'.
Niel was unconsciously watching
his companion's face and following
his thoughts, and presently said, as
though in answer to something that
had gone before: “Then ye think
she'll drift in here, if onywhere?”
Willy started as though he had
been struck, for there seemed a
positive brutality in this way of
putting his own secret belief. He
faced Niel quickly, but there was
nothing in his face of any brutal


158 
thought. On the contrary, the lines
of his face were so softened that all
his likeness to his sister stood out
so markedly as to make the heart
of her lover ache with a fresh pang
—a new sense, not of loss, but of
what he had lost. Niel was surprised 
at the manner of his look,
and his mind, working back, gave
him the clue. All at once he broke
Out:
“O Willy, mon, we'll never see
her again Never! never ! till the
sea gies up its dead. What can we
dae, mon? what can we dae ? what
can we dae ?”
Again there was a new wrench to
Sailor Willy's heart. Here were almost 
Maggie's very words of the
night before, spoken in the same
despairing tone, in the same spot,
and by one who was not only her


159
well-beloved brother, but who was,
as he stood in this abandonment of
his grief, almost her living image.
However, he did not know what to
say, and he could do nothing but
only bear in stolid, patient misery
the woes that came upon him. He
did all that could be done — nothing
— but stood in silent sympathy and
waited for the storm in the remorseful 
young man's soul to pass. After
a few minutes Niel recovered somewhat, 
and, pulling himself together,
said to Willy, with what bravery he
could :
“A'll gang look after father. A've
left him owerlang as 'tis " The
purpose of Maggie's death was beginning 
to bear fruit already.
He went across the field straight
toward where his father's cottage
stood under the brow of the slope


160 
toward the Water of Cruden. Sailor
Willy watched him go with sadness,
for anything that had been close to
Maggie was dear to him, and Niel's
presence had been in some degree
an alleviation of his pain.
During the hours that followed
he had one gleam of pleasure —
something that moved him strangely 
in the midst of his pain. Early
in the morning the news of Maggie's 
loss had been taken to the
Castle, and all its household had
turned out to aid vigorously in the
search. In his talk with the lieutenant 
and his men, and from the
frequent conversation of the villagers, 
the Earl had gathered pretty
well the whole truth of what had
occurred. Maggie had been a favorite 
with the ladies of the Castle,
and it was as much on her account


161
as his own that the mastership of
the harbor had been settled prospectively 
on MacWhirter. That this
arrangement was to be upset since
the man had turned smuggler was
taken for granted by all, and already 
rumor and surmise were busy
in selecting a successor to the promise. 
The Earl listened, but said
nothing. Later on in the day, however, 
he strolled up the cliff where
Willy paced on guard, and spoke
with him. He had a sincere regard
and liking for the fine young fellow,
and when he saw his silent misery
his heart went out to him. He tried
to comfort him with hopes, but, finding 
that there was no response in
Willy's mind, confined himself to
praise of Maggie. Willy listened
eagerly as he spoke of her devotion,
her bravery, her noble spirit, that


162 
took her out on such a mission;
and the words fell like drops of
balm on the seared heart of her
lover. But the bitterness of his
loss was too much that he should
be altogether patient, and he said
presently:
“And all in vain all in vain |
She lost, and her father ruined ; his
character gone, as well as all his
means of livelihood—and all in
vain God might be juster than
to let such a death as hers be in
vain "
“No, not in vain " the Earl answered, 
solemnly; “such a deed as
hers is never wrought in vain. God
sees and hears, and His hand is
strong and sure. Many a man in
Buchan for many a year to come
will lead an honester life for what
she has done ; and many a woman


163
will try to learn her lesson in patience 
and self-devotion. God does
not in vain put such thoughts into
the minds of His people, or into
their hearts the noble bravery to
carry them out.”
Sailor Willy groaned. “Don’t
think me ungrateful, my lord,” he
said, “for your kind words; but I'm
half wild with trouble, and my heart
is sore. Maybe it is as you say - and 
yet — and yet the poor lass went
out to save her father; and here he
is, ruined in means, in character, in
prospects — for who will employ him
now, just when he most wants it?
Everything is gone—and she gone,
too, that could have helped and
comforted him 1"
As he spoke there shot through
the mind of his comforter a thought,
followed by a purpose not unworthy


164
of that ancestor whose heroism and
self devotion won an earldom with
an ox-yoke as its crest and the circuit 
of a hawk's flight as its dower.
There was a new tone in his voice
as he spoke:
“You mean about the harbor-
mastership 2 Don't let that distress
you, my poor lad. MacWhirter has
lapsed a bit, but he has always borne
an excellent character, and from all
I hear he was sorely tempted. And,
after all, he hasn't done — at least,
completed — any offense. Ah !” and
here he spoke solemnly, “poor Maggie's 
warning did come in time. Her
work was not in vain, though, God
help us all! she and those that loved
her paid a heavy price for it. But
even if MacWhirter had committed
the offense, and it lay in my power,
I should try to prove that her noble


165
devotion was not without its purpose — 
or its reward. It is true that
I might not altogether trust MacWhirter, 
until, at least, such time as
by good service he had reestablished
his character. But I would and shall
trust the father of Maggie MacWhirter, 
that gave her life for him; and
well I know that there isn't an honest 
man or woman in Buchan that
won't say the same. He shall be the
harbor-master if he will. We shall
find in time that he has reared again
the love and respect of all men.
That will be Maggie's monument - 
and a noble one, too, in the eyes of
God and of men !"
He grasped Willy's hand in his
own strong one, and the hearts of
both men, the gentle and the simple, 
went out each to the other, and
became bound together as men's


166 
hearts do when touched with flame
of any kind.
When he was alone Willy felt
somehow more easy in his mind;
the bitterest spirit of all his woe — 
the futility of Maggie's sacrifice — 
was gone, exorcised by the hopeful
words and kind act of the Earl, and
the resilience of his manhood began
to act.
And now there came another distraction 
to his thoughts — an ominous 
weather - change. It had grown
colder as the day went on, but now
the heat began to be oppressive,
and there was a deadly stillness in
the air; it was manifest that another
storm was at hand. The sacrifice
of the night had not fully appeased
the storm-gods. Somewhere up in
that Northern Unknown where the
Fates weave their web of destiny a



 167
tempest was brewing which would
soon boil over. Darker and darker
grew the sky, and more still and
silent and oppressive grew the air,
till the cry of a seabird or the beating 
of the waves upon the rocks
came as distinct and separate things,
as though having no counterpart in
the active world. Toward sunset
the very electricity of the air made
all animate nature so nervous that
men and women could not sit quiet,
but moved restlessly. Susceptible
women longed to scream out and
vent their feelings, as did the cattle
in the meadows with their clamor-
ous lowing, or the birds wheeling
restlessly aloft with articulate cries.
Willy Barrow stuck steadfastly to
his post. He had some feeling — 
some presentiment — that there
would soon be a happening — what,


168 
he knew not; but, as all his
thoughts were of Maggie, it must
surely be of her. It may have been
that the thunderous disturbance
wrought on a system overtaxed almost 
beyond human endurance, for
it was two whole nights since he
had slept. Or it may have been
that the recoil from despair was acting 
on his strong nature in the way
that drives men at times to desperate 
deeds, when they rush into the
thick of battle, and, fighting, die.
Or it may simply have been that
the seaman in him spoke through
all the ways and offices of instinct
and habit, and that with the foreknowledge 
of coming stress woke
the power that was to combat with
it. For great natures of the fighting 
kind move with their surroundings, 
and the spirit of the sailor


 169
grew with the storm - pressure
whose might he should have to
brave. -
Down came the storm in one
wild, frenzied burst. All at once
the waters seemed to rise, throwing
great sheets of foam from the summit 
of the lifting waves. The wind
whistled high and low, and screamed
as it swept through the rigging of
the flagstaff Flashes of lightning
and rolling thunderclaps seemed to
come together, so swift their succession. 
The rain fell in torrents,
so that within a few moments the
whole earth seemed one filmy sheet,
shining in the lightning-flashes that
rent the black clouds; and burn
and rill and runlet roared with rushing 
water. All through the hamlet
men and women, even the hardiest,
fled to shelter — all save the one


170
who paced the rocks above the
Watter's Mou', peering, as he had
done for many an hour, down into
the depths below him in the pauses
of his seaward glance. Something
seemed to tell him that Maggie
was coming closer to him. He
could feel her presence in the air
and the sea; and the memory of
that long, passionate kiss which
had made her his came back, not as
a vivid recollection, but as something 
of the living present. To
and fro he paced between the flagstaff 
and the edge of the rocks;
but each turn he kept farther and
farther from the flagstaff, as though
some fatal fascination was holding
him to the Watter's Mou'. He
saw the great waves come into the
cove, tumbling and roaring, dipping
deep under the lee of the Ship's


 171
Starn in wide patches of black,
which in the dark silence of their
onward sweep stood out in strong
contrast to the white turmoil of the
churning waters under his feet.
Every now and again a wave
greater than all its fellows — what
fishermen call the “sailor's wave" —
would ride in with all the majesty
of resistless power, shutting out for
a moment the jagged whiteness of
the submerged rocks, and sweeping
up the cove as though the bringer
of some royal message from the
sea.
As one of these great waves
rushed in, Willy's heart beat loudly,
and for a second he looked around
as though for some voice, from
whence he knew not, which was
calling to him. Then he looked
down and saw, far below him, tossed


172
high upon the summit of the wave,
a mass that in the gloom of the
evening and the storm looked like
a tangle of wreckage — spar and sail
and rope — twirling in the rushing
water round a dead woman, whose
white face was set in an aureole of
floating hair.
Without a word, but with the
bound of a panther, Willy Barrow
sprang out on the projecting point
of rock, and plunged down into the
rushing wave whence he could meet
that precious wreckage and grasp
it tight.
Down in the village the men
were talking in groups, as the
chance of the storm had driven
them to shelter. In the rocket - 
house opposite the salmon-fisher's
store had gathered a big cluster,



173
and they were talking eagerly of all
that had gone by. Presently one
of them said:
“Men, oughtn't some o' us tae
gang abeen the rocks an' bide a
wee wi' Sailor Willy? The puir
lad is nigh daft wi' his loss, an' a
wee bit companionship would no
be bad for him." To which a
sturdy youth answered as he stepped
Out:
“A'll go bide wi' him. It must be
main lonely for him in the guardhouse 
the nicht. An' when he's
relieved, as A hear he is to be, by
Michael Watson ower frae Whinnyfold, 
A'll gang wi' him or tak
him hame wi' me. Mither'll be
recht glad to thole for him !" and
drawing his oilskin closer round his
neck, he went out in the storm. As
he walked up the path to the cliff



174 
the storm seemed to fade away — 
the clouds broke, and through the
wet mist came gleams of fading twilight; 
and when he looked eastward
from the cliff the angry sea was all
that was of storm, for in the sky was
every promise of fine weather to
come. He went straight to the
guard-house and tried to open the
door, but it was locked ; then he
went to the side and looked in.
There was just sufficient light to
see that the place was empty. So
he went along the cliff looking for
Willy. It was now light enough
to see all round, for the blackness
of the sky overhead had passed, the
heavy clouds being swept away by
the driving wind ; but nowhere
could he see any trace of the man
he sought. He went all along the
cliff up the Watter's Mou', till, following


175
the downward trend of the
rock, and plashing a way through
the marsh — now like a quagmire,
so saturated was it with the heavy
rainfall — he came to the shallows
opposite the Barley - mill. Here he
met a man from the Bullers, who
had come along by the Castle, and
him he asked if he had seen Willy
Barrow on his way. The decidedly
negative answer—“A've seen nane.
It's nae a nicht for ony to be oot
that can bide wi'in '"—made him
think that all might not be well
with Sailor Willy, and so he went
back again on his search, peering
into every hole and cranny as he
went. At the flagstaff he met some
of his companions, who, since the
storm had passed, had come to look
for weather-signs and to see what
the sudden tempest might have


176 
brought about. When they heard
that there was no sign of the coastguard 
they separated, searching for
him, and shouting, lest he might
have fallen anywhere and could
hear their voices.
All that night they searched, for
each minute made it more apparent
that all was not well with him ; but
they found no sign. The waves still
beat into the Watter's Mou' with
violence, for, though the storm
had passed, the sea was a wide-stretching 
mass of angry waters,
and curling white crowned every
wave. But with the outgoing
tide the rocky bed of the cove
broke up the waves, and they
roared sullenly as they washed up
the estuary.
In the gray of the morning a
fisher-boy rushed up to a knot


 177
of men who were clustered round
the guard-house, and called to
them:
“There's somethin' wollopin'aboot
i' the shallows be the Barley-mill !
Come an' get it oot | It looks like
some ane !” So there was a rush
made to the place. When they
got to the islands of sea-grass
the ebbing tide had done its
work, and stranded the “something” 
which had rolled amid the
shallows.
There, on the very spot whence
the boat had set sail on its warning 
errand, lay its wreckage, and
tangled in it the body of the
noble girl who had steered it — 
her brown hair floating wide and
twined round the neck of Sailor
Willy, who held her tight in his
dead arms.


178 
The requiem of the twain was
the roar of the breaking waves
and the screams of the white birds
that circled round the Watter's
Mou'.
THE END.
