MISS BETTY
CHAPTER I
GRANDFATHER'S STORY
OF all the incidents of her early life none
had so great or lasting an effect on
Betty Pole as those of that evening in Cheyne
Walk on which she had been accused of breaking 
the blue china jar. This was one of those
beautiful pieces, brought from Holland, which
had been given to her grandfather by the
Dutch Minister when on some diplomatic
mission to King William III. Great store
had been set on it by the household generally,
and Betty's mother had often, during her lifetime, 
enjoined on the children special care
of the beautiful piece of oriental china. She
always said that it was to be looked upon as
a sort of heirloom in the family.
The charge against Miss Betty was made by


2
Abigail, she coming right into the back sitting room 
after supper, when the dusk was beginning 
to fall through the trees in the garden
of the King's House in Chelsea. Abigail's
manner was at all times a pronounced one,
for all her kindness of heart ; but she was not
feared so much by the children, who knew the
softness as well as the weight of her hand, as
by the two men whom she controlled in the
despotic manner which purely domestic women
assume to lonely men -- men who have not
wives to protect them. Abigail had in the
motherless household the honour and privileges 
of one whom the mother had trusted,
and who by faithful service had earned the
trust. As a rule she was a just woman, but on
this occasion the violence of her demeanour
almost implied to those who knew her that she
was herself not quite blameless in the matter.
They all knew that she would not wilfully and
deliberately lie, but they felt that the occasion
was a grave one, and one in which no one
would willingly be under the imputation of
guilt if it could be avoided. Some of them,
face to face with the charge, would have held
it justifiable to have deflected the current of
public thought if they could not on such an
occasion have stemmed it. The young people,



3
one and all, with wonderful unanimity, denied
the charge which had at first been made in the
general form of one of the children.' The two
men were concerned, as men ever are regarding
the breakages of things they value. Betty's
father, Charles Pole, was as near anger as his
gentle nature and the sorrow of his too recent
loss would let him be. He spoke severely of
the need of care, and reminded the children
that their dear mother had ever told them to
be careful of this thing that she loved ; and
then the sight of their little black clothes
seemed to smite him and he stopped speaking,
for he knew that to that mother's heart one
moment of any of his children's happiness was
dearer than all the vessels which had ever
grown under the potter's hand. She had
accepted on her marriage the motherhood of
the four children of her husband's first wife,
and treated them all just as she afterwards
treated her own little Betty, her only child.
After a spell of silence Betty's grandfather,
Dudley Stanmore, spoke-
“I am sorry that the jar, which had for me
very dear memories, has been broken ; but we
must not forget to be just. Tell me, children;
which of you broke it ? ”
There was no answer. Then the old man


4
spoke again, this time more sternly; his voice
was grave and strong, despite his ninety and
odd years—
“Let whoever did this, own to it !” All
were still silent. For a few seconds the old
man's face looked very stern; but then came
a smile and a sigh of relief, and he said
quietly-
“Well, Mistress Abigail, that is all right! I
am glad that none of the children did it.” This
was more than Abigail could brook, so she
answered hotly-
“Oh yes! saving your presence, but they
did ;” and turning to the children added : “Ye
know, children, that God hates a liar, and that
liars stand without the Gates and go into the
burning Pit. Now, tell me, which done it?”
Marjory, who though not the eldest had pertness 
beyond the level of her years, answered-
“None of us did it, Abigail! Did you?”
“Me! Me? you wicked Miss.
wicked Miss. You! Miss
Betty. You were last in the room—what do
you say to it?"
Betty, who was sitting in her usual place on
a little stool at her grandfather's knee, said
gently, in her sweet, old-fashioned way-
“I know nothing of it, Abigail! When I
was in the room I was reading.”


5
“ Take care, Miss Betty, take care! now
take care !” said Abigail hotly, as she raised a
warning finger. “Tell the truth.”
“But I am telling the truth,” said the child.
Here her grandfather joined in :
“My word for Betty's truth! She would
not speak falsely! Would you, dear?”
dear?” The
child looked up, turning her head so that the
wrinkled hand which he had laid on it slipped
down on her shoulder.
" Oh no, grandfather!” she answered quietly;
“how could I?"
“Old master always sticks up for Miss Betty,”
said Abigail tartly, “just because she is his
kin, I suppose—and so like him!” she added,
with a touch of feminine causticity.
The likeness was remarkable, despite the
gulf of more than fourscore years that lay
between them. The old man's face was
wrinkled, his hair fell in thin, straggling flakes
of snow, his eyes were dim, and his tall form
was bowed with years, whilst the child's hair
was golden-brown, her eyes were sapphire, and
her skin had the freshness and the warm glow
of youth.
But there was in each the same
inward calm, the same line of profile, the same
delicacy of nostril, the same resolution of
mouth ; and, beyond all else, that something


6
which can hardly be put in words—the capacity
of exaltation.
Betty's father now spoke reprovingly--
Abigail Hood, you forget yourself when
you so address Mr. Stanmorę. Greater respect
is due to him! And beside, he would say
nothing but what is true. If Betty is like him,
then I thank God that it is so; for her life
should be pure and strong and true, like that
of her dear mother.”
Abigail was prepared to do battle only up to
a certain point, and as there was nothing here
to be argued she used with deadly effect her
purely feminine arms. Taking up the corner
of her apron and holding it to her eyes, she
withdrew. Mr. Stanmore then rose, and
taking Betty's hand in his, said —
“Come! We will go and see the broken
jar and find out, if we can, what is the cause
of it.”
The other children followed, and they all
passed up the wide staircase into the drawing-
room overhead. At the back of the house the
dusk was now more marked, and the trees and
their shadows were mixed; but in the front the
sunset still struck the summer clouds high overhead 
and made a sort of after-glow which gave
light enough to survey the damage.


7
Truly the jar was broken, but it had evidently
been lifted from its place and had been overturned. 
When the old man saw it he said
Why, Betty could not have done it. She
could not have lifted it if she had tried. We
must find out something more about it.
As he spoke there was a sound of sobbing
outside. The door opened and Abigail entered,
pushing before her a maidservant who held her
apron to her eyes.
“Here she is! Here is the hussy what
broke the jar. I taxed her with it, and she
can't deny!”
“ If you please, master, I am main sorry,
but the jar was on the floor where Mrs.
Abigail put it for me to put out the old
popery and put the new rose-leaves in ; and
then I was called away. When I came back
I forgot all about it, and when I was dusting
round knocked it over.” Here she made a
vain effort to fall on her knees to her master,
and her further utterances became undistinguishable.
“Get up, girl! Get up!” said the old man.
“ Don't insult the Creator by kneeling to
There, run away now, and be more
careful in future. Your crying won't mend
broken china !” and, still sobbing, she was

8
incontinently hustled out of the room by
Abigail. The old man lifted the broken jar
and put it again in its old place, and then,
taking Betty by the hand, led the way back
to the room below.
When they had resumed their old places,
the room being now in a deep twilight, one
of the boys said : “Tell us a story, grandfather.” 
The old man paused, and then iron
said-
“I will tell you something, my dears,
which comes back vividly to my mind tonight. 
Mrs. Abigail said how like my dear little
Betty is to her grandfather, and I said myself
that I knew she was true. Perhaps it is these
two things together that take my mind back
seventy years and more- further than the
span of a man's life. It was when I was
brought before the great Cromwell, not long
after the King had been martyred.”
As he spoke the last words the old man's
voice was instinct with reverence, and he stood
up. As he paused one of the boys said,
“Great Cromwell!' He wasn't great. He
was a traitor." The old man answered—
Traitor or no traitor, he was a great man.
Sometimes when I look back through the
dimness of my age I wonder where, in time


9
to come, the measure of his greatness shall
But we will not talk of this now.
Suffice it that in the days I speak of the
world called him great.
He was the victorious general of a conquering army.
He was the head of the State—in the eyes of
some; the head of the Parliament and the
general of the Parliament's forces, and his
iron will was felt throughout the land. I had
been an officer of the King's household, and
had some knowledge of usage in foreign
matters ; but when the Parliament slew the
King I refused to serve longer under those
who made him a martyr, and so I went away
from London and stayed in Much Hadam,
where my great - aunt had her home. Not
very many days had passed when a letter
came demanding my presence in London.
To this I replied, respectfully but still firmly,
that inasmuch as my services and my
faith
had been those of my King, I could not now
give to others the fealty which had been his.
“And was there any answer ?” said Betty,
nestling closer to his knee and looking up
into his face with her earnest eyes.
Any answer! My faith, child, but there
answer! Before another day had
passed it came in the shape of a troop of


10
soldiers, who arrived covered with dust and
with their horses foaming, for they had ridden
from London during the night. They had
a warrant for my arrest, signed by Cromwell
himself ; and they, only waiting to bait their
horses before starting took me back to
London. They treated me civilly enough
They said their orders were to show me all 
due respect, and they were a fine set of
fellows, I warrant—tall men and strong, and
earnest and grave in their ways and bearing
Aye, children, they were earnest men, those
old Ironsides, whatever any one may tell you
now; and, my faith! but they spoke and
fought as though they believed in the
righteousness of their cause.”
“ Oh fie! grandfather,” said Marjory, in her
pert way, “to speak for traitors—and you a
King's man!”
Nay, child,” said the old man gravely
“it is no shame to speak truly of any man.
The truth is a purging fire that cleanses all
it touches, and it would be shame to me,
and you might well cry ‘Fie!' upon me if
any malice on my part bore down truth.
And moreover, my dear, I was a King's man
then, and a King's man when his son came 
to his own again, and a King's man in the


11
old succession till James, tampered with our
faith, and made me a King's man to Dutch
William and his English Queen. And a
Queen's man am I now—and shall be whilst
good Queen Anne is spared to rule. All these
****2 e different Kings, and there be many who
hold that the Crown of England should rest
on another head; yet you cry not ‘Fie!' upon
those who bled with the King when he
fought against the King. But there! these
things are beyond you, I fear. You will
know more and understand better hereafter."
“Well, but go on, grandfather! Tell us
of the soldiers,” said one of the boys. “Go
on ! Don't mind Marjory; she's always
interrupting. Keep quiet, you Marjory, and
don't trouble us !” he added, in the dictatorial
way of brothers.
“Well, we never drew rein till we rode
into Whitehall, and then and there, all booted
and spurred as I was and white with the
summer dust, I was taken before Cromwell
himself. He received me standing, and put
his questions simply and directly. I listened
in silence, and after a pause spoke-
“Sir, I may not answer. When the evil
time came and my King was butchered, I
who held loyal service as his due, resigned


12
my place and sought that solitude which
should be the right of every Englishman-
if England is, as you boast her to be, free
Whereat the hands of the grim Ironside
around me instinctively sought their sword
and I tell you that for all my brave words-
and I meant to die for them if need were
—my heart beat quick and heavy. But
Cromwell looked me steadily in the face
and spoke out-
“Well said, young sir! That is the
speech of a true Englishman, and God
forbid that I or those who hold with me
should deem it ill on thy part to do thy
duty boldly—even though our duty to follow
it were to send thee to the gallows for it
But think, young sir! mayest thou not have a
higher duty than even the loyalty of doing
nothing in memory of a dead man? Hath
England no claim upon thee? Hast thou no
duty to her? Is there no work in the
present to which the hand of a loyal
Englishman can be turned ? It is a grave
question that thou hast to answer; and yet
thou thinkest it meet to be silent. Thou has
much knowledge of certain matters; and
even earnest men, for lack of such help as
thine, may blunder into rougher ways of


13
Statecraft than were needed. Nevertheless
thou shalt go free, for I cannot see in thy
face other than the look of a true man.
** and back there, and let him pass! I am
of Essex stock myself, and know his home
and lineage. There is naught but truth in
his blood; and England never needed true
Men more than now. Bethink thee, in the
future, sir, when the time comes for other
face
grave choice, that thou hast chosen blind
obedience to a dead fancy rather than the
the call of living England—that England for
Whom men like these have shed their
blood !' and with a grave sweep of his arm
he took in the whole ranks of soldiers and
statesmen who stood around him. I turned
to the door, feeling of such small worth that
though I had risked my very life in the
boldness of my words, I knew that my going
was without dignity. No one else moved
to the extent of a hair ; I opened the door,
passed out, and closed it again.
“And then, hardly had I crossed the
threshold, than there came over me such an
overwhelming sense of duty undone that I
almost reeled. Who and what was I that
I should hold my hand or my tongue, when
in England, in the very throes and stress of


14
civil war, might need me? What was duty?
that I should deny its call ? What was truth?
And, my dears, in that instant the answer rose
before me as if, like Belshazzar's doom, it has
been written in fire upon the wall—that truth
and duty were one, and that both must be
obeyed at all sacrifice of self. My duty
seemed then a simple thing enough. I had
no more right to hold back my doing than 
to refuse to risk my life. The duty must be 
done, whatever the risk, whatever the pang.
“And then I turned and opened the door
again, and walked in silence into that room 
with head erect-I had left it with downcast
head. And then the great Captain stepped 
forward to meet me, and took me by the hand 
and said : Well done, thou good and faithful 
servant!' and it seemed to me that truth and 
duty, though strong together, were imperfect 
but that with faith the perfect trinity appeared 
But this is all over your heads. Run away 
to bed now, children ! Good-night!”. And 
the old man sank back into his chair, as 
though the full weight of his ninety years had 
come upon him all at once.
As she gave her good-night kiss Betty 
murmured in her grandfather's ear--
“I think I know, grandfather! Faith and 


15
Duty and Truth are like three candles with
but one light,” and she walked gravely away,
whilst the old man's eyes followed her lovingly.
When the children were all in bed and
Betty's father had gone to work in his study,
her grandfather went up to the nursery and
tapped softly at the door. Mrs. Abigail came
quickly and opened it. She was about to
make some remark, when the old man held
up a warning finger and said softly-
“Is Betty asleep? Please look into her
room and see. I do not want to disturb her
if she is.” Abigail, with an inaudible protest
against disturbing people when they were
going to bed after a hard day's work, softly
opened the door of Betty's room. The child
was not asleep, for she spoke at once. Abigail
beckoned to the old man. He entered the
room, and the nurse shut the door softly and
went back to her own room, but without protest
of any kind this time, for there was something
so grave in the old man's face-something so
sweet and yet so earnest—that it awed her
A little, and unconsciously her womanhood
admitted the dominance of the man.
As he entered the room the child said, in a
most natural way-
“I knew you would come, grandfather.”


16
The old man was a little startled, for such
visit was a rare thing indeed on his part, and
the subject had not been mentioned between
them. Indeed his own intention to come had 
been formed long after she had said good-night
And yet there was something so genuine and
unforced in the utterance, as though it was the
natural conclusion of a train of thought, that
the old man was strangely moved ; and as he 
sat beside the little cot he said brightly-
"Why Betty, my dear, you seem to know 
things by instinct.”
Oh, I don't know, grandfather ; but sometimes 
when I am told things, or see or heard 
them, other things come into my mind all at
once.”
Then, as the child took his great hand in
her little ones and drew it to her breast and
nursed it, visions of other faces rose before him
and mingled with hers, so that the past and the
present—the living and the dead-became 
embodied in the one sweet childish presence
The story of his thought was so well written
in his face that the child, looking into his eyes
whispered softly-
"Tell me, dear grandfather ; what are you
thinking of ?---tell me all.” After a pause the 
old man spoke to her in a low, solemn voice.

17
It was a strange, albeit so sweet and peaceful
a scene. The lamp which the old man carried
was laid on the table at the foot of the cot so
that its light might not dazzle the eyes of the
child, and the two were in shadow, deep save
for the reflected light from the walls of the
room and the dim echo of the moonlight
through the yellow curtains. The child's face
was framed in her little white muslin cap, with
just here and there a stray tangle of her sunny
brown hair peeping through. Her sapphire
eyes were grave and earnest, and the likeness
of the child to the old man was more strangely
great even than before.
My child, it seems strange of me to talk of
such things, but there is a spell upon me
to-night. Mayhap that the old memories are
awake and are growing stronger still as the
end draws nearer.” The child held his hand
tighter and closer to her breast, but said not
a word, though a tear gathered in each eye
and rolled slowly down her cheeks as she lay.
" For the end must come some time, my dear,”
he added, as he saw the tears. Stooping, he
kissed her forehead, and then, with his silk
handkerchief, wiped the tears from her sweet
little face.
“ All the faces I have loved seem
gathered in yours to-night. The face of my


18
mother, who, when a child like you, stood with
her mother on the heights of Portland Bill ad
saw the great Armada sweep up the Channy
and watched the beginning of the fight that
ended in its annihilation. My mother it was
who taught me to be true above all things and
not to fear to do that which my conscience told
And I see, too, the face of my wife, whom
I had known when she was scarcely bigger
than you are, and who grew up to love me as I
had loved her all along; who counselled me
ever in the way that was most honourable and
most true; who mourned when my master
suffered at the hands of his foes; who, when
saw the work of that Cromwell who had taught
me my duty to England pass away, told me I
had been right to choose even death for my
conscience' sake, and to act on it when it
showed me a new path ; and who, alas ! left
me with my little daughter when God's time
came for her to go home to Him. And I see,
too, the face of that little one-so like you, my
dear, that half a century seems gone and that I
see her lying in her little cot, what very time
the Great Plague was on us that the Great
Fire later purged away.” The child held his
hand closer and tighter still. “And I see, too
the face of her daughter.”



19
“ That's me, grandfather !” said the child
brightly. The old man shook his head.
“Nay, nay, my dear. Time runs. More
quickly than you think. I speak of your
mother, my child, who stood with me in the
streets of London and saw Dutch William
enter. Your mother, my child's child; for
Betty, dear, you are my great-granddaughter,
though we always call you granddaughter.
But that is naught to me, my dear,” he added,
earnestly and quickly, seeing a look of disappointment 
crossing the child's face. " You
are all the more dear for the years that have
elapsed, and for all the love and the sweet
memories that go to mould you in my heart.
Nay, I can say with all truth that as my life
ebbs away and I come nearer to the time when
I shall meet my dear ones who have gone
before, I love best of all the little one whom
I must leave and whose love I shall bear to
them when we shall meet. But these are sad
thoughts for a child, and I must leave you to
rest; nevertheless I want to tell you, Betty
dear, something which I always intended you
to know. When I have passed away all that
I have is to be yours; it is in the hands of
trustees; what this means you will know later.
But there is one sum which is kept apart and


20
which is to be yours and yours alone, and
which you are to deal with when you please
and how you please. I want to ask you not to
use that money lightly. Keep it till feel
that there is real want of it ; that it can do
some good thing such as your heart tells is
good—when it can avert some calamity. It is
a trust given to me long, long ago by one who
had sinned deeply and had greatly atoned, and
who knew the value of help given freely and at
the right time. I have never had cause to use
it, and I want to pass over the trust to the
nearest of my own kin. You will keep it for
me, Betty, will you not?”
“I shall do as you wish, grandfather,” said
Betty gravely, and added : “ Please God!”
Then the old man went on : And now, my
child, good-night. We are not likely to speak of
this again ; in the morning I shall not allude to
it, but I wanted you to know it! Good-night
my child, and God keep you in His sight and
His heart of hearts, so that you may walk in
His ways all the days of your life!” and he
bent over and kissed her forehead.
Then the deep love of the child's heart spoke
She rose in her cot and flung her arms
round the old man's neck and kissed him. The
tears ran down her cheeks as she sobbed out-


21
Good-night, great-grandfather—and grand-
father too!” She lay back on her pillow and
choked down her sobs while the old man once
more dried her eyes and bid her cheerily good-
night.
When the footsteps sounded in the passage, ,
Abigail came out and asked him if he wanted
anything. He shook his head, nodded her a
kindly good-night, and passed into his own room.
In the morning Abigail came into Betty's
room and dressed her herself ; when the child
had knelt at her knees and said her prayers,
the woman said to her quietly-
“Don't rise yet, Betty dear; I have something
to tell you, but you must not be frightened.”
To her astonishment Betty answered gravely-
Don't fear, Abigail, I am not afraid; grandfather 
is dead!”
“Lord have mercy on us !” said the woman,
startled, “but how did you know it, Miss ?
We only learned it half an hour gone, and I
came right here lest you should be shocked to
hear it sudden. Who learned you of it ? ”
“No one, Abigail; I seemed to know. Last
night he spoke to me as if he was going away.
(Oh, grandfather! dear, dear, grandfather !”
For a moment the child broke out into a


22
paroxysm of weeping; but as suddenly she
stopped, and, drying her eyes, said,
“May I see him, Abigail ? I shall be very
good.”
Yes, Miss,” she answered, after a pause,
"but not yet—not till after--not till this after-
noon.”
Then Betty went and sat in the window-seat
and cried quietly all to herself till the time had
come.


CHAPTER II
DOGGETT'S COAT AND BADGE
IN the ten years that had elapsed after her
great-grandfather's death Betty Pole had
many subjects for after-remembrance. Queen
Anne had passed away; Marlborough had won
glorious victories, had been a traitor twice
told and had fallen ; the royal vultures had
gathered round the deathbed of the Queen,
and the hopes of the Stuarts had been for
ever shattered. King George had come, and
ruled in London a German Court by German
ways. In Betty's own family, too, there had
been many changes. Her father had been
dead more than six years, and his sister who
had come to take his place still waged a pretty
even battle with Abigail. The latter had
grown fatter and greyer, but her heart was as
stout as of old and her tongue as sharp.
Many a hard knock Miss Priscilla had had


24
to take in the way of words; but she was a just,
shrewd woman and knew Abigail's worth and
fidelity too well to quarrel with her for a show
of temper. She never failed, however, to have
her revenge, and in time Abigail came to know
that she had met more than her match in the
patient, well-tempered woman who bided her
time and gave a home-thrust when that time
came.
The elder children had all gone their own
ways. One of the boys had become a midshipman 
and was away with the Southern fleet, and
the other had just been gazetted a cornet in
the Green Horse Dragoons. Marjory, the
pert, had married a Scotch Writer to the
Signet and was at present engaged in nursing
her first baby in Edinburgh, whilst her elder
sister, Lucy, lay beside her baby and her
husband too in the deep sea beyond the
Dogger Bank where the Queen of Sheba went
down with all hands.
Betty was now an heiress to a considerable
fortune, for during her long minority the money
and estate which her great-grandfather had left
her had been used to great advantage by her
trustees: 'Every year the account in Mr. Child's
bank grew larger. Even the nation wanted
money badly at times, and the most active


25
trustee, the shrewd merchant, Mr. Fenton, of
Finsbury Square-Betty's cousin on her father's
side—who advised the dealings with her money,
,
knew well how to open his hand and when to
close it; and each year's end found that his
judgment in such matters was always right.
He was a somewhat hard, stern man, this Mr.
Fenton, now a London alderman, and to some
he seemed of an icy temperament ; but in his
own way he loved his gentle, high-bred cousin,
and was proud of her. He would often confide
to his cronies that some day she should have
such a fortune as would show the world what a
London merchant could gather in the span of
one life.
His sister, who lived with him, shared
his love for Betty, who well knew that there
was always a loving welcome for her from the
stern old pair in the City.
There was only one point on which the old
merchant was unsatisfied, and that was the
sum of one thousand guineas which, by Mr.
Stanmore's will, lay in the hands of Mr. Child
to be paid only to Miss Betty Pole on her own
order, when and how she would—all wishes
even of her trustees to the contrary notwithstanding. 
Once he spoke to her about it and
she listened in silence whilst he spoke-
“ It is a shame, lass, I tell ye; simply a


26
shame to let a sum like that lie idle. I
could turn it over and over again in a year
and make each guinea into ten. Why, what
with their fancy stocks, their South Sea schemes,
and their East India Companies and the like,
these fools run mad in the hunt for the shadow
of wealth ; and men who know what money
and business mean look on and keep their heads
cool till the time comes. I could use this sum
alone in such a way that if ye had naught else
in the world it would let ye hold up your head
with Miss Mendez herself. What with this
and your youth and beauty you might pick
a husband from the heirs of the Russells and
the Montagus! Be wise, child, and let me
deal with that as I have dealt with the rest !"
Then Betty answered very quietly, as she took
his hand and held it, as she used to hold her
grandfather's—it was a pretty trick she had and
it seemed to become her well-
" Thank you, indeed, dear Cousin Fenton,
for all you have done for me. Aunt Priscilla
often tells me how good you have been to me,
and how well you have dealt with my fortune,
and I am not ungrateful. Indeed, indeed I am
not! But my grandfather spoke to me of that
money the very last time I saw him—the very
night he died—when he told me of his mother


27
who had seen the Armada, and of his wife who
had cried at King Charles's death, and of his
daughter who had been through the Great
Plague and the Great Fire, and of her
daughter, my mother, who had seen King
William enter London. And he gave me a
trust that I must keep!”
Here Mr. Fenton struck in-
“Oh, if there is any secret-
Betty still
held his hand in one of hers whilst she laid
the other on his lips.
“ No secret indeed, cousin—now do not be
angry with me,I am sure that if you knew all
you would be the first to tell me that I am
right.”
The old gentleman yielded at once to her
soft influence and stroked her hand, as he
answered
"There, there, my dear, I won't say
another
word—not one! Do as you please, and if you
see any duty, do it.
But for the life of me I
can't see what duty there is in not multiplying
one by ten.”
Just then his sister, Cousin Hester, came in,
and other matters were spoken of. That night
it was arranged that Cousin Hester was to
come and stay for a few days in Chelsea at the
old house in Cheyne Walk so as to see the


28
great race amongst the watermen for the
orange-coloured coat and silver badge given by
Mr. Doggett, the comedian. This race was
expected to be a very fine affair ; it was to be
held on the 1st of August, in memory of the
crowning of King George the year before, and
a great company were expected to be on the
river that day. The race was to be amongst
six young watermen, who were to start from the
“Old Swan,” near London Bridge, at the ebb
of the tide and row up the river as far as the
White Swan Inn at Chelsea. All the Livery
of the watermen were to be there, all the great
City companies were to send their State barges,
and many noblemen and gentlemen of quality
arranged that their barges and wherries would
be out that day. As the barges were sumptuous
affairs, gay with bright colours and gold, with
canopies of rich stuffs; and as oarsmen and
other servants were glorious with the richest
liveries, the sight was expected to be a fine one
indeed.
When the day came there was more splendour
even than had been expected, for the ministers
were wary, and they thought it possible that so
great a concourse might afford an opportunity
to the enemies of the House of Hanover to
make manifest their disfavour. As the German


29
succession was too recent to allow of any such
chance being ignored, it was thought advisable
to have a great display of the forces of the
Crown—albeit in a purely pacific manner and
simply as an addition to the pageant. And so
each warship at the Nore and Tilbury and in
the docks and at the wharves of London sent
some of her boats to the show. Dapper and
business-like they all seemed as, in perfect time
with flashing oar-blades and steersmen bending
double at each stroke, they swept in and out
amongst the floating mass. They were every-
where along the whole course, not seeming of
set purpose; but from the Tower to Chelsea
there was no stretch of water without its navy
boat full of alert, swarthy, pig-tailed fellows,
cutlass on side and pistol in belt ready for any
emergency.
And then again there was another addition,
more showy if less effective at a pinch. All
the boats of the King's household were out.
Indeed, there seemed to have been here some
attempt to make as brave a show as possible ;
for even all those boats whose antique shapes
and time-worn timbers seemed to have entitled
them to rot away in peace, had been furbished
up and sent out, gay with paint and gold, to
add to the splendour of the scene. These


30
royal boats, each carrying the Standard, made
a numerous muster, and the scarlet of the royal
livery with the great badges of the King's
watermen almost as large as breastplate and
back-piece, caught the eyes of the multitude.
In each of the royal boats sat some gentleman 
to represent his King. In some of the
great barges were high officers of State, each
with a party of ladies and gentlemen, all radiant
with rich clothing.
Especially noticeable
were all those in any way connected with
ceremonial or pleasure, the Lord Chamberlain,
the Master of the Horse, the Master of the
Hounds, the Master of the Hawks. In others
were less important personages, and even in
the wherries and smaller pleasure boats were
some young gentlemen of family or degree, as
an overt sign of the magnitude and importance
of the Court party. In the great barge of
the Company of Drysalters, Alderman Fenton,
as was right, had a place. Betty had the boat
of four oars which her brothers had used to
delight in, made brave for the occasion, and
she, with Aunt Priscilla and Cousin Hester, sat
on blue cushions in the stern, whilst Mrs.
Abigail had a seat all to herself in the bow and
looked after the baskets with the dinner, which
was to be taken on the water to-day. Everything


31
was astir on the river hours before the
race, and all sorts of trials of strength and
speed were undertaken, and all sorts of mishaps
occurred. The river ran strongly in the
reaches between Vauxhall and Battersea, and
in such a throng there were many novices. But
help was always at hand, and the sun was
bright and warm ; men and women and girls
and boys were on pleasure bent, and all were
gay and happy.
Betty's boat took several turns down the
river as far as Vauxhall Gardens, and the eyes
of its occupants enjoyed to the full the life and
rich beauty of the scene.
Several times they were passed, either going
up or down the river, by one of the royal
boats, which seemed gifted with a divine uneasiness. 
It was powerfully manned by four
splendid oarsmen, whose bronzed faces, tattooed
skin, and precision of stroke, showed them to
be men-of-war'smen who had donned the royal
livery for the occasion—a state of things
noticeable to the eye of a keen observer in
many of the royal boats. They never seemed
to tire, but swept up and down as though to
show off their strength. There was only one
other person in the boat, a young gentleman
who steered. He was a handsome young fellow


32
with black hair and dark eyes and a proud
bearing, and he carried well the elegant dress
which he wore. It did not seem to strike either
of the elder ladies that there was a method in
the constant passing and repassing of their
boat ; but Betty seemed to realise it in some
way, for she never raised her eyes as the boat
swept by—that is, she never raised her eyelids, 
but looked out between her long eyelashes,
as even the fairest and sweetest young women
do when a strange young man of elegant
appearance is in the immediate foreground.
As for Mrs. Abigail, communing with herself
in the solitude amongst the pasties and chickens
and bottles, her mind was quite made up.
Here at last was the true Prince Charming,
whose heart the young mistress whom she
idolised was to win. His bright, handsome
face, his resolute bearing, his stature and form
- for he looked lithe as a panther and strong
steel—his royal surroundings, and the
manifest admiration of his glances at Miss
Betty as he ran his barge instinctively as close
as he safely could, all satisfied the faithful old
woman's requirements, and the time seemed
impossibly and exasperatingly long until he
should formally declare himself. After all is
told, what is so enduring, so strong, or so


33
complete as an old servant's protectorship over
the future of the child she has reared ? Abigail
got more and more impatient as the time went
The day was hot, for the August sun was
blazing, and she took off her hat to fan herself. 
This hat was a treasure, something that
Abigail valued as the apple of her eye. Betty
called out to her-
“ Take care of your hat, Abigail ; if you let
it drop you know the current will
carry
it
under some of the boats."
They were at this time up close to the “Swan,”
where a great assemblage was gathering to
watch the close of the race, which was now
going on. Down the river was heard a roaring
which was taken up as the boats passed along.
A way was kept clear in the centre of the
stream, and to insure this the boats drew right
and left. This occasioned some confusion,
especially on the left bank, where the current,
glancing off the projecting promenade in front
of the King's house, drove the boats together.
Betty's oarsmen, who knew the river, kept
the boat in her place by judiciously modulated
strokes; but some of the other boats were not
so well handled, and one of them came swiftly
down the current towards the mass of craft.
Some of the men in the other boats called out


34
-especially the gallant-looking young gentleman 
in the royal barge, who had taken up his
position a little down the stream and out
towards the centre, from whence he could see
Betty.
Abigail, intent on watching the young
gentleman, did not see the coming boat, and
when the collision came, though it was not
much in itself, it so upset her that she dropped
her precious hat to catch the gunwale of the
boat, and the current in an instant swept it
away. Betty saw it coming by and tried to
catch it. It was just beyond her reach, and so,
with hand on the gunwale, she leaned over as
far as she could and just succeeded in grasping
it. But at that instant the colliding boat,
fended off at first by the hands of its occupants,
again struck Betty's boat. The shock, slight
as it was in itself, was much to her in her
position of poise, and threw her into the water.
There was an instant shout, and then Priscilla
and Hester clutched wildly at where Betty's
head had been, and many a voice was raised
and many a hand stretched out.
But quickest of all the throng was the young
gentleman in the royal boat! Hardly had
Betty sunk under the water when he had
leaped to his feet and dived after her. He


35
was a strong swimmer and caught her as she
rose, and with a few powerful strokes of his
right arm took her with the stream, whilst his
own men bent to their oars and followed him.
But it is no light task to swim amongst a
press of boats in a current, and especially
when one has to support two and with only
one hand available for the purpose.
two boats in such a case can be helpful, but a
mass of them makes new danger,
entangled, those who should sit quiet stand
up, and those who can help are hampered ;
boats which to be useful should be held still
and on an even keel, are rocked to and fro till
they themselves become a positive source of
danger. So it was on this occasion. The
mere multitude of rescuers and their variety
of plans, made a small danger into a great one.
So skilful and strong a swimmer as this man
evidently was, could have easily held her up till
help came ; but with the current, the swaying
boats, and the closer ingathering mass there
an added danger of being crushed.
He took in the situation at a glance, and
with a boldness and readiness which commended 
itself to every man present who could
swim, he dived beneath the boats, taking with
him Betty, who had not uttered a sound and


36
who now yielded herself quietly quietly to his
guidance. His oarsmen, who, seeing the
danger and recognising his course of action,
had skirted round the press of boats and were
waiting at the other side when he came up,
immediately seized him. He gasped out to
them : “ Take the lady!” and instantly four
strong hands raised her and lifted her into the
barge whilst he himself clung to the gunwale,
panting
Instantly all those around began to cheer in
true British fashion ; even those in the mass
of boats up and down and across the stream
who had not seen what had happened but
knew from the struggling and the pressing
together of the boats and by the cheers that
something unusual had taken place, took up
the shout till down the stream the waiting
crowd seemed to be in doubt as to which way
the race was coming. Priscilla and Hester,
both pale as death, held one another's hands
tight, and Abigail, with no one to hold on to
except the oarsman, clasped her own hands
and said her prayers, as a good woman
should do in time of danger-and at other
times. Close to Betty's boat there was at this
time another royal barge with several old
people splendidly dressed. One of them, a


37
man with white hair and the ribbon of the
garter, said in Abigail's hearing to the lady
beside him—
“ By the Lord ! splendidly done. I never
saw anything better or readier in my life. He
is a fine fellow! Who is he?"
“I can tell you,” came the answer, “for I
asked just now.
His name is Rafe Otwell.”
" Who is he?"
Oh, the usual thing !-a poor gentleman.
Some sort of kinsman of Walpole.”
There was a bitter undertone in the reply-
Poor ! and a kinsman of Walpole! He is
a distant kinsman then, of course."
“Fie, my lord, fie! You politicians are
more severe on one another than we ladies-
are supposed to be.”
“ Well, kinsman of Walpole, near or far
though he be—and the farther the better,
say I !he is a gallant fellow, and a ready
fellow; in my time such qualities counted for
much!"
By this time the boat containing the two
rescued people was in mid-stream and the
onlookers had forgotten the incident, for the race
was now close up and all eyes were directed
towards the approaching wherries. Betty's
oarsmen cleared the press of boats and drew


38
to shore, the royal barge following. When
they got close in the young gentleman leaped
ashore and his men put down a stretcher for
Betty to walk to the bank, and she took his hand
to steady herself. Sweet and beautiful she
looked as she stood there in the brilliant sunshine, 
though her white dress was sorely
draggled and clung to her so that she could
hardly walk. The pallor which was con-
sequent on her danger had given way to a
bright blush, and as the young man held her
hand she tried to thank him. Betty was not
good with words when she wanted them, and
sometimes those to whom she spoke--and to
whom she wrote—thought that the simplicity
of her words showed coldness. It was not so,
however; the sincerity of their purpose was
all-in-all.
“I thank you, sir,” she said simply “I
thank you with all my
heart!” And, after all,
what could she have said nicer had she spoken
a volume ?
“ Nay,” he answered, “the thanks are mine
that I have been permitted the honour of
serving you!”
Further talk was cut short by the embraces
of her aunt and cousin, who had gained
the bank and now wept over her and rejoiced


39
in physical contact, to the great detriment
of their costumes. Abigail too came up and
embraced her and finished an outpouring
of rejoicing at her mistress's safety and of
anger towards herself for causing the accident,
with the following-
And, God save us, if the darling child
hasn't kept the hat all the time!”
Betty looked down; she had quite forgotten
the hat, which she held in her hand dripping
many-coloured tears. The young gentleman
said gallantly-
Such faithfulness is indeed strange!”
Abigail instantly capped his speech-
“ You wouldn't think it strange
if
Miss Betty, sir."
Hush, Abigail !” said Betty.
Then Aunt Priscilla spoke-
“Sir, we do not know how to thank you.
This dear child's life is more to us than we can
say; but, indeed, we are very, very grateful."
She held out her hand, and the young gentle-
man took it ; but to his surprise and indeed to
his consternation she stooped and kissed his
hand.
“No, no!” he said, “not that, Madam-not
that!"
Sir, I must show my gratitude somehow !


40
Were I younger or you older I might take
a different way! But come, sir,” she added,
our home is yonder in Cheyne Walk. Come
with us and dry your clothes.”
“No, no!” he answered, “it is nothing ; I
shall be less wet presently and a ducking does
no harm."
By this time Betty was moving off, but on
hearing him refuse she stopped.
“At least, sir,” she said,
you will not
refuse to let us make you welcome!"
He said nothing but bowed, and they all
moved off towards Cheyne Walk.
Betty was hurried to her room by Abigail,
who rushed about getting cordials which she
insisted on her taking, and wept and laughed
over her; whilst the stranger, after being duly
dosed with cordial—which he did not refuse-
was shown into another room where was the
whole wardrobe of Betty's father. He made
his choice of clothes, and presently appeared in
the drawing-room. Here he formally introduced 
himself to the two ladies, Betty not yet
having appeared.
" Ladies, allow me to introduce myself, since
good fortune for me, though bad for-” he
looked from one to the other of the elderly
ladies, as if in doubt—" for your young sister,”


41
the ladies here smiled not displeased, “has
taken the place of social usage. My name is
Rafe Otwell. I am a gentleman of the Temple,
though I regret to say as barren of law as I am
of means.
I am a kinsman of Sir Robert
Walpole, who promises me a place as soon as
I have been called to the Bar. I am a sometime 
scholar of Cambridge, and my home,
when I had one, was in Cheshire."
To which Miss Pole replied-
“Sir! you may be poor-Providence rules
in lesser matters of the world as in greater
things—but you are a gallant gentleman and
have played a ready as well as a brave part
this day, and if my dear brother, Betty's father,
were here, he would thank you better—than I
-than I can—" and here the
” and here the poor lady's
emotion overcame her and she burst into
tears.
" Don't cry! there Mistress, don't cry!” said
the young man, all his ceremonial stiffness gone
in a moment. “ There is nothing to cry for.
She is alive and well! All is well! There
now, don't cry!” In the midst of this, when
the young gentleman was half embracing the
elderly lady at his side, in well-meant efforts
to comfort her, Betty entered the room. She
instantly became the objective point of all the


42
embracings and all the tears; and for awhile
rejoicing, in the form most objectionable to a
person not in the game, was rampant. Suddenly 
Hester said-
“Those men who picked you up were not
even thanked. I will go and thank them,”
and she went down to the edge of the river
opposite where the royal barge still hung on
her oars, though the mass of boats save those
clustered around the landing at the “Swan
were on their way back to London.
“We have come to thank you,” said Miss
Fenton; and with an inspiration added : “Won't
you have something to drink?"
Their answer
was unmistakably and decidedly in the
affirmative.
“Come to the house yonder,” she said.
“Not for worlds, Miss. We daren't go
ashore without leave.”
Here, however, Betty appeared, followed
by Abigail and a blushing maid who carried
four tankards.
'God bless you, Miss,” said the sailor who
was spokesman for the rest. “ You should be
an Admiral's lady.”


CHAPTER III
THE GOLD BUTTONS
RAFE'S introduction of himself was followed
by a more formal one, for amongst his
few friends was a lady of Ware, to whom Betty
Pole was of course known from her estate at
Much Hadam, and the young people met at a
kettledrum at her house. By this time he was
head over ears in love with Betty; he would have
declared himself but for that restraining sense
of his own unworthiness which Providence has
been good enough to implant, for the protection
of young maidens, in the hearts of young men.
But this sense lies latent only until such time
as a true attachment manifests itself, whereupon
it asserts all its strength. This force, however,
like all great forces, is active and reactive; and,
like other forces, what it loses in strength, it
gains in direction, and vice versa. For the
timorous young maiden when she feels assured


44
that her lover holds back through some strange
weakness which is alien to feminine nature-
and her heart never fails to tell her when this
is so-takes heart of grace and gives freely,
if not ostentatiously, that which timid self-
consciousness fears even to ask. Si la jeunesse
savait! Well, if it did, the young would cease
to be young. The decadence of old age came
into the world at the first bite of the apple,
and wrinkles formed an appropriate punishment
for the sin of Eve.
Betty's course of thought was masked by her
habitual direct simplicity. She made up her
mind on the necessary points, and took all the
rest for granted. Indeed, had she done anything 
foolish-which she did not-it would
have been excusable. Here was a young gentleman, 
only a few years older than she was, ,
handsome, stalwart, brave, of gallant bearing,
and of high connections—and to whom she
owed her life. His only disqualification in the
eyes of the world did not matter in her case;
for if he was poor, she had enough for both,
and it would be only an added sweetness to say
to him when the time came-if it ever did
come—"I give you all I have, Rafe! And
yet how little! You gave me your name-a
woman has none worth having in our English

45
law; my life is yours already,” and so forth.
The day-dreams of a young maid are very
tender; and somewhere at base of them is ever
some such idea of self-sacrifice.
But though these young people met often-
by premeditated chance—such meetings were
not often enough for them, and Rafe took to
calling at Cheyne Walk more frequently than
the strict rules of ceremony demanded. Aunt
Priscilla was not, however, a very fiery dragon,
and the only effect of his frequent visits was to
keep her in a state of constant expectation. As
he might at any time come she thought it well
to be always ready for such a contingency, and
so the requirements of a small household of
two women became gradually enlarged to meet
the needs of a third person, that person a man
and a stranger. Abigail never grumbled, and
we may be sure the maids did not, at all the
extra trouble.
The meetings of the young people became
more full of eloquent silence than they had
been. Betty and Rafe did not speak even so
much as had been usual at first, for as they
grew to understand each other better, fewer
words sufficed. Occasionally they walked
together on the path by the riverside, up and
down, up and down before the house, never

46
further than the eyes of Aunt Priscilla could
follow them as she sat in the window of the
drawing-room embroidering. For worlds Betty
would not have gone beyond this limit—not
that she feared Aunt Priscilla or the proprieties,
but she was a resolute young person when her
mind was made up, and she had set this limit
for herself. Often they watched the sun set up
the river and saw the shadows grow darker
and darker over the hill that rose away to
Clapham and Wandsworth. At such moments
no speech at all was necessary, for the hearts
of the two beat as one heart, and though
nothing had been spoken they knew that they
loved. Their only doubt on earth was of their
own worthiness of each other.
At last one evening when Rafe called there
was a certain air of resolution manifest on him,
awkwardly borne, but which made the heart
of Abigail rejoice for she knew by instinct what
was coming. He used generally to ask for
Miss Priscilla, but to-day his request was to see
Miss Pole, and he was shown into the drawingroom.
Whenever he had called previously he
had usually found Betty alone, or if she was
not in the room, she came alone and was
shortly followed by Miss Priscilla ; but to-day,
after a delay, Betty came in accompanied by



47
her aunt. To accomplish this there had been
a little skirmishing, for Betty declared that she
would not go in alone.
How Betty did talk that afternoon—she that
was usually so silent! She did not allow the
chatter to flag for a moment. Every topic of
conversation that could be imagined she
exhausted ; and her aunt sat in amazement,
secretly bridling at this unwonted vivacity. As
Betty chattered and as Aunt Priscilla's back got
stiffer and stiffer, so also Rafe's temper seemed
to give way a little. His answers grew more
monosyllabic and a sort of cloud settled on his
brows. But the more glum and dour he
became, the brighter grew Betty. She teased
and rallied him till Priscilla grew indignant and
began to take his part; whereupon she grew
more merry still, and, making an excuse, slipped
out of the room and rushed up to her own
chamber. There, after locking the door, she
threw herself face down on the sofa and began
to cry
The instant that Betty was out of the room
her aunt changed her tactics, and began to
make excuses for her. The dear child had not
been quite herself lately; the weather seemed
to affect her, and so forth. Rafe was not slow
to acquiesce in these excuses; his real love for


48
her, and his somewhat ruffled vanity both came
to his aid, and the atmosphere began to clear.
In the midst of this process Betty returned, but
without a sign of tears upon her face. She
was one of those women whose beauty tears do
not mar. It is well for some women that it is
so, and that in this way the wind of adversity
is tempered to them. Betty was in a mood not
quite the same but very slightly different; she
was not less cheerful, but she did not tease ;
Rafe felt the sunshine of her presence again
begin to glow around his heart.
By some feminine diplomacy which has no
match in the nature of man, Betty so arranged
matters that she was not left alone with Rafe
for a single moment. When Priscilla made an
effort to leave in order to get a book for
Mr. Otwell, Betty started up and insisted that
she should get it. When Abigail came to the
door and craved the elder lady's presence for a
moment it was the younger one who went.
And all the while she was so sweet and winning
that Rafe loved her better than ever for his
defeat.
Presently, as a last resource, he asked
her if she would not walk on the river bank
and watch the sunset. Betty at once acquiesced
and ran off to get her hat and wraps. She


49
came back with two hats and two wraps,
Priscilla's and her own, and insisted, then and
there, that her aunt should share the pleasure.
Rafe, secretly chafing but all the while amused,
could of course only acquiesce, and the three
took a series of prim promenades along
the river bank under the trees. Betty so
maneuvered that her aunt was always in the
middle ; if in the course of turning to retrace
their steps this arrangement became upset, she
with some deft movement restored it again.
Rafe did not enjoy that walk. Things somehow 
seemed to be running the wrong way.
Had he been older !-Si la jeunesse savait !
The burden of the old saw is ever the same,
and its application is eternal !
When they came back to the house Betty
was as sweet as usual, with the exception
that she would not allow Rafe an instant's
opportunity of love-making or even of being
alone with her. When he asked her to sing
something for him she sat down to her harp
and sang in a manner of enchanting archness
a little song which whilst it provoked her lover
made him more in love than ever. As she
bent over to the harp in one of the most
graceful attitudes that woman can assume, and
swept the strings till they trilled in sympathy


50
with her arch merriment, she looked towards
Rafe bewitchingly, but in such wise that she
seemed to look through and beyond him-a
fact which, through all his love, inflamed that
jealousy which is possible to all men.
" What will you sing ?” Rafe had asked.
“Love at play'!” she answered, and straightway began-
“He is not dead—nor sleeping !
The playful Boy pretends to die-
See ! see ! he peeps with laughing eye,
He tests the lover's truth with weeping.
" Love is naught but lying.
Its wiles are jests to earnest carried,
When Cupid smiles on lovers married,
The thought that troubles least is dying.
“Lovers be happy toying!
Still be children whilst ye may !
Ye will be grave in coming day.
Youth, not age, is the season of enjoying.
When the song was done Betty rose quickly
and sat down primly close beside her aunt; she
was silently demure during the whole time that
Rafe remained. Seeing that he could get no
further with his suit, Rafe, concealing his
chagrin as well as he could, took an early leave.


51
When Betty was alone with her aunt the
latter took her to task gravely.
Betty dear, don't you think you were a
little hard on that young gentleman ?"
Betty opened her eyes wide in seeming
surprise as she answered artlessly-
Hard, aunt! how do you mean?
“How do I mean, my dear? Eyes don't
grow as old as mine without being able to
understand what they do see. That young
gentleman is just breaking his heart for you.”
“For me, aunt?” This was spoken with an
exquisite softness.
Yes, my child. Can't you see—or won't
you see—that he is head over ears in love with
you?”
“Oh no, aunt; that cannot be."
“Can't be! What do you mean, child ?”
Betty answered, with a strange mixture of
shyness and drollery : “He never told me so.'
"Upon my word, young lady, you are too
bad ! You are—you are, just like other
girls !"
“And besides, aunt, I am not sure of the
worthiness!"
Indeed, my dear, I am sure he is worthy.
True, he is poor ; but, my dear, you are rich
enough to please yourself; and, my dearest


52
Betty"—this was said very gravely—“do not
trifle with the best part of a man, the sincerity
of his heart. A good man, dear, is a very
great and noble thing, and worth a woman's
love."
“But indeed, aunt, I did not mean that he
was unworthy. Oh no! oh no! oh no!” and
the deep, dark blue eyes filled with tears.
" Who, then ? "
It is I who am not worthy!” and she
threw herself into the arms opened to receive
her.
Aunt Priscilla understood all, and comforted
her.
The very next day Master Rafe called again.
This time he was not nervous, for he had made
up his mind that though he would wait for a
suitable opportunity he would seize the very
first which might come. He found Betty in
the drawing-room alone, and she received him
very sweetly, so sweetly that he felt that he
Was at one with her, and then and there
blurted out what he fondly thought was his
secret.
“Oh, Betty, I love you with all my heart !
Won't you take me? I shall be a true and
loving husband to my life's end !” Betty sat
silent for a moment, for it was too sweet a


53
pleasure to shorten, and so he went on:
“I have been so miserable, Betty, since last
night that I have never slept. I came here
yesterday to propose to you, but somehow I
never got a chance. Tell me, Betty—tell me,
dear, that you love me, or I shall be miserable
all my life.”
Betty raised her earnest eyes, and looked
him full in the face, as she put her two hands
in his, and said, with a shy sweetness that
made his heart thrill-
“Do not be miserable, Rafe, ever any more!”
He caught her in his arms, and their lips met
in their first kiss. The first kiss is a holy thing.
It should be the symbol of spiritual marriage
—of the union of two souls; the youth and
maiden who feel this can never really love, at
least the same way, again.
Priscilla waited as long as she thought
proper, and then, with a little flutter in her
heart, opened the door and walked in with the
commencement of an apology on her lips.
That apology, however, was never completed,
for the lovers, who had been holding each
other's hands, drew apart instinctively, and
Betty, blushing rosy red, jumped up and ran
over to her aunt and kissed her, and then laid
her head on her bosom. Rafe rose up and


54
took one of her hands, and with an old-
fashioned gallantry stooped and kissed it, and
Priscilla, too, blushed. Blushing on such occasions 
is the first preliminary to feeling at ease,
so presently all three sat on the sofa, Rafe
leaning back very happy and with an all-
conquering air about him which both women
secretly admired. Priscilla held one of Betty's
hands in hers, and stroked and smoothed it
lovingly, whilst the other lay emptily in her
lap, Rafe being too new a lover to dare to take
it in his-openly.
Supper that night was a glorious meal.
They were all merry and light-hearted, and
Abigail herself waited on them, to the chagrin
of the maids who wanted to see for themselves
how things went whilst the news was very new
indeed.
Betty had rushed upstairs for a moment to
tell Abigail, but had had no need to speak; the
news was written plain in the radiance of her
face, and the old woman threw her arms around
her and sat down and took her on her knees
as she used to do when she was a child.
Indeed, that evening Abigail seemed to have
gained a new importance. She behaved exactly
as usual, but in a more genial way; she excused
everything that went wrong, unless it bore on


55
the proper entertainment of the guest. When
parting time came Aunt Priscilla had a message 
to give to Abigail who was waiting to
receive orders, and as this took some time to
get through and required much talking in a
loud tone, so that the impossibility of immediate 
disturbance was made manifest, the young
people had a full and satisfactory opportunity
of parting—as newly plighted lovers should
have. It is but just to say that they availed
themselves of it.
When he came next day—and his visit was
much earlier than ever before-Rafe had presents 
for all the women. To Aunt Priscilla he
ventured to give a souvenir of his deep appreciation 
of her many virtues, in the shape of an
exquisite little gold patch-box shaped like two
hands clasping, which, when open,
showed each
hand complete in itself. To Abigail he gave a
large silver money-box, shaped like a German
peasant's hat, for he said that it was her
original loss in the shape of her hat which
was the occasion of his great gain, and he
had ventured to put within a something where-
with to purchase another hat. Abigail, having
admired its external appearance, and having
put off looking within as long as seemliness
required, opened it and found within ten bright


56
guineas, and went off at once to fill the maids
with wonder and envy at the beauty and worth
of her gift. Strangely enough, Aunt Priscilla
had on his coming perforce to withdraw herself
on household duties, which she did with a needless 
elaboration of apologies. Then, when he
and Betty were alone, and when they had
taken by a common instinct their old seats on
the sofa, he gave Betty her present. It was 
an Indian ruby set in brilliants-evidently an
heirloom--and when he had put it on the
third finger of her left hand, he kissed the
finger, and said that it was now his and that
he was the very happiest person on all the
earth. This assertion Betty, as she nestled
close to him, doubted; but she did not then
proclaim herself, for the love of her heart was
as yet like the green corn when it timidly puts
its head above the earth—not like the same in
the autumn, when its ripening time has come,
and it rustles as it waves its head openly in the
sunshine that it loves.
Betty's life had been so retired that she had
not many friends whom it was necessary to tell
of her betrothal, but such as there were had
to be duly informed, although it was thought
wise to say as little as possible about the
engagement, since so long a time must elapse

57
before its fulfilment. All this involved much
letter-writing, and kept her very busy; not,
however, too busy to have a delightful time
with her lover when he came, which was pretty
well every day. The guardians were of course
informed very soon; and although they grumbled
a little, and said that a young lady of Miss
Pole's fortune and prospects might have done
much better, when they came to know that
their ward really and truly loved, they consented
to the engagement. They insisted, however,
on the stipulation mentioned in her great-grandfather's 
will, that she should not be married till
she was of full age. This was two years and
three months off, and it seemed to both the
young people to be a cruelly long time to have
to wait. As, however, they were not forbidden
to meet as often as they would, their engagement 
was a delightful time.
It was, perhaps, a foolish thing of Rafe not
to have gone at once to his kinsman, from
whom he expected so much, and have told him.
This he often felt; but as at first he had not
done so, he dreaded more and more the hard
inquiry that would infallibly come : “And pray,
sir, why did you not inform me of this at the
first? Am I no one that I should be thus
ignored?"



58
One day he was sent for by his kinsman,
now the virtual ruler of England, since he controlled 
both the Treasury and the Exchequer.
When the interview commenced Walpole told
him that he would shortly place him in a great
position, as the time had come when he, Sir
Robert, should consolidate his power by all
means possible, and that he wished to have
allied to himself a certain great house that
might be dangerous in opposition.
You,” he said, “are to marry the Lady
Mary. It is true that she is no longer young ;
but you have youth and good looks for both,
and I warrant me she will not complain of
those qualities in you! You do not seem elated
with the opportunity,” for Rafe's face had fallen
and his feeling was only too plain, “but be good
enough to remember, young sir, that though
you have youth and a fair presence, these comprise 
all your present possessions. When you
go into the market with a full purse you may
pick and choose, but when your purse is a slim
one-if purse you have at all, or wherewithal to
put in one—you must take what you can get.
Understand me plainly: I am willing to help
my kinsmen, and you amongst the number, but
in turn they must help me. If you will not do
as I want, then you cannot expect that I will


59
do as you want. When you can come to tell
me that you are willing to carry out my project
I shall appoint you forthwith to the post I
spoke of; but time does not stand still, and
lacking you, I must choose some other suitor
for my Lady Mary, and his must be the reward
I reserved for you.”
Rafe was ushered from his presence with a
very formal and distant bow.
As we know, Rafe did not lack physical
courage ; in face of all dangers to life and limb
he was a brave man. But his moral courage
had not been tested ; had it been, he might
have spoken out at once to the Minister, and
told him of his betrothal to the young heiress.
Had he done so he would doubtless have found
new favour in the eyes of his kinsman, who
had a shrewd head and knew the worth of
such an alliance ; and his interests in life would
have been advanced in some other way. So
Rafe went home and fretted and fumed and
cursed his luck, for by this time he had nearly
come to the end of his resources.
He had much wished to make Betty a
present, but he had hoped that his nomination
to a place would have come at once, and that
he would then be better able to give something
worthy of the acceptance of a young lady who


60
had so much of her own already. Now he
found his chance of place gone—for the time at
all events and but a small store of guineas remaining 
of his inheritance. So it was with a
somewhat saddened joy that he took his way
to Chelsea that afternoon.
There was a source of interest in the household 
which, however, he did not share. Betty's
brother had come up on leave of a few days
from his regiment, then quartered at York, and
naturally the household was full of his presence.
Rafe, who only knew of him as Betty's half-
brother, was not any too delighted, and held
himself somewhat stiffly, though for Betty's
sake he tried to be as cordial as he could.
Robert Pole, too, seemed to have some slight
holding back from his sister's suitor. He had
a vague idea that the latter was in some sense
an interloper ; and as he had a special design
in his own visit, not unconnected with certain
debts incurred since the receipt of his commission, 
and which could only be removed
through the agency of a rich sister, he wished,
perhaps not unnaturally, to have that sister to
himself as much as possible. With every
minute he began to jar more and more on Rafe.
There was with his sister a sort of taken-for-
granted superiority, and an almost rudeness of


61
manner which their having been children
together made possible, but which in the
jealous eyes of the lover--for such thinks no
refinement sufficiently worthy for his beloved
seemed coarse and intolerable. Lovers have
many crosses to bear in the time of their probation, 
and not the least of them are placed on
their shoulders by the brothers and sisters of
their beloved, whose familiarity seems a trifling
with a sacred thing.
Betty could not but be conscious of the
state of feeling between the two young men,
and tried to keep the peace between them.
Rafe felt that she was an angel, and loved her
more than ever. He loyally strove to further
her wishes, and would not see or understand
when some specially caustic remark was aimed
at him. Now and again he and Betty
exchanged glances which showed that they
understood each other, and in this silent
sympathy he found a great reward for his
forbearance. Aunt Priscilla was sublimely
unconscious of all that was going on and took
an early opportunity to whisper to Betty-
“How delightful it is that they understand
each other so well. They have become great
friends already.”
Once Betty feared there would be a scene.


62
Robert, with a brother's freedom, took Betty's
hand in his, and noticing the ring, said-
“Hallo! this is something new. I wonder
at your wearing such a beggarly thing among
those fine ones.'
Betty blushed up to the roots of her hair,
for she felt, as did Rafe, that an insult to the
latter's gift was intended, but as she did not
wish to foment a quarrel she smiled with what
heart she could and kissed the ring, saying-
“Never mind, brother, let who will have the
rest—this is good enough for me!”
“ Indeed but it's not,” he answered, with a
sneer; “ I have given a better to an innkeeper's
daughter!”
Betty's heart sank within her, but Rafe's
look reassured her. Then, as she had
shrewd idea as to what Master Robert's
visit was really due, she thought of a way-
albeit one that seemed a little ungenerous- 
to make him at least behave with decorum.
Master Robert wanted a lesson, and he should
have it! So she answered
“Oh! Robert, how can you be so extravagant! 
Surely it is not a necessity of being
in the Green Horse that you should be so
lavish! I did not know that a cornet's pay
allowed such openhandedness!”


63
Robert felt that he had gone too far. He
knew that he had yet to explain the disposal
of the fifty guineas sent to him not long before
in answer to an urgent request, and beyond this
again that another hundred at the present time
would hardly suffice to meet his more present
needs. So he determined on a discreet
measure of silence, and tried to change
entirely the whole current of conversation.
After a moment's thought he jumped up,
calling out-
“Come, Betty! put on your hat, and we'll
all go pay a visit to Don Saltaro and see his
museum. I haven't seen a mummy or a 
mermaid, or a whale's tooth since I left for
York!”
Betty was glad of the change, and as she
looked pleased, Robert was pleased to be
out of the difficulty of his own creation. So
in a good humour the three young people
adjourned to Don Saltaro's museum before the
afternoon should have become too late for the
presence of ladies in the coffee-house. They
admired everything, and the Don, who thought
much of his aristocratic neighbours, came him-
self and explained everything to them. With
great ceremony he took down from its hook
on the wall a splendid old Spanish sword,


64
beautifully hilted and of immense length.
This, he told them, had belonged to a captain
of the Armada, and was evidently an heirloom.
Look!” he said ; “see here are the arms,
and there a writing on it in the Spanish
tongue. Young lady, your eyes are better
than mine. Do you please to read it, that
these young gallants may learn how the old
Spaniard loved!”
Betty, blushing brightly, took the sword
and read the legend on the blade-
“El Amor del infiel es como la Espada
destemplada.'”
“Can any of you construe it?" asked the
Don. No! Then is it to me, to whom are
many tongues. “The Love lacking faith is as
a sword untempered.' What think you of that,
young lady?'
It is true," said Betty gravely. "There is
a lesson in the sword of that old Spanish
gentleman which every man and every woman
should take to heart!” The Don cried :
“ Bravo! Bravo !” and Robert applauded,
whilst Rafe looked his acquiescence.
Rafe did not return to supper, for he felt
that it would be easier for Betty if he were
not present to notice—and perhaps to cause
her brother's rudeness. So at the gate he


65
said farewell, not in his usual style but in a
ceremonious way befitting a public occasion,
and went back to the Temple in a waterman's
wherry.
The legend on the sword had given him
an idea. He would have it worked out in
some jewel for Betty! And as he was rowed
down the river with the ebbing tide his idea
took a definite form. He would have wrought,
by some cunning goldsmith, a set of buttons
in gold of some old Spanish device, such as
that which embellished the sword, and on each
should be graven a word of the legend. Then
he bethought him whether it would be better
in Spanish or English, for the wording of
the sentence allowed either ; and the happy
idea came to him that he would have each
button to contain a word of Spanish and a
word of English, but in such a way that
the sentence should run the reverse way, the
last of one series being the first of the
other.
The perfecting of his idea pleased him, and
he forgot all the disagreeable part of his
meeting with Betty's brother; and so he
landed at the stairs at Westminster and sought
the sign of the “Golden Ball” at Windmill
Street in the Haymarket. There he confided



66
to Paul de Lamerie, the Crown goldsmith,
his wishes. He rejoiced that the latter liked
the idea, and would therefore produce something 
which should be a pleasure to Betty.


CHAPTER IV
RAFE'S OPPORTUNITY
RAFE paid one more visit during Robert's
stay, for he did not wish it to appear
as though he avoided the house on account
of Betty's brother ; but he was secretly rejoiced 
when, on his following visit, Abigail
told him that Master Robert had gone back
to York. The young gentleman had returned
to his regimental duties somewhat richer in
worldly goods than when he had come ; but he
was also richer in certain caution and advice
of a sisterly kind which rankled in his breast
during the whole of the journey between
London and York. Betty had impressed upon
him the necessity of at least some measure
of prudence in his expenditure, lest he should
have to end his military duties before they
were well begun ; she had also, but in a more



68
guarded way, made it perfectly plain to him
that his attitude to his new brother-in-prospect
was not such as to insure in the family that
peace and affection whence bounty for the
prodigal had its only possible source.
“In fact,” summed up that fairly shrewd
young gentleman, “I have made a cursed fool
of myself, and Betty sends me packing with
a flea in my ear!”—a conclusion which, though
somewhat coarsely expressed, did infinite credit
to his judgment. Henceforth he passes out
of our story. He loved his life while it lasted;
and his calls on Betty's liberality became so
extravagant that had he not had the misfortune 
to challenge a more expert and soberer
swordsman than himself, it might have become
necessary for her guardians to interfere. His
one touch with Rafe had been truly but a
slight one, but it had the consequence that
the mind of the latter was made up to bestow
on his lady a gift worthy of her, though at an
expense which, when the goldsmith had received 
his payment, left only a few lonely
guineas in the treasury of the kinsman of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Rafe kept the buttons in a case in his
pocket, waiting for a suitable opportunity of
giving them to Betty ; and when he found that



69
the house was rid of the embarrassing presence
of Robert he knew that the time had come.
That evening, when the sun was going down
in the west, he asked Betty to come with him
to the river bank and watch the sunset. She
put on her hat, and they went out together.
They walked by the rows of trees opposite
the King's House, and, passing up the marshlands, 
came to the jutting bank whence they
could look over the watery waste and see the
sunset mirrored in every bend of the river,
every little tidal stream, and every stagnant
pool.
Here there was a grove or clump of trees,
and passing through these they stood on the
edge of the bank with the full tide brimming
right up to their very feet. All the pools and
rivulets of the marshes of the opposite bank
to right and left were full of water, and the
marsh-land looked as if shot with gold or silver
as the water caught the glow of the sunset or
showed cold without it. The sun sank slowly
down towards the far-off bend of the river,
where the willows fringed the banks between
Wandsworth and Putney and the river blazed
in a glory.
The rise of the ground towards Clapham
and Wandsworth seemed bolder than in a


70
colder light, and on the further edge rose
the gibbet, black and grim, which marked the
winding of the Portsmouth road. As she
pointed out the beauties and answered Rafe's
queries Betty had a strange pleasure, for it was
sweet beyond measure to be able to instruct
her lover ; but she shuddered when, in answer
to his query, she told him of the black gibbet.
Then, as the sun sank, he took the case with
the golden buttons from his pocket and handed
them to her and told her, with sweet words
and a look that was an anthem, that he had
tried to get something which she would like
and which might be worthy of her. When she
opened the case and saw the buttons she gave
a cry of delight and kissed his gift ; then she
took out a button and saw that there were
words on it in Spanish and English, and at
once she guessed at the legend and read it
right through both ways. Then she turned
to Rafe, and, secure that the grove of trees
hid them from the gaze of any prying wanderer, 
put her arms around his neck and kissed
him on the mouth and told him that she would
value his dear gift till her dying day.
And so the sun sank into the water in a last
flood of crimson and gold; and then in an
instant the whole colour of the scene changed,


71
the gold of the sunshine turning to the silver
of the moonlight. The air seemed colder
as the lovers retraced their steps to home,
where they found Priscilla looking anxiously
for them, for they had never been out so
long together before. That evening, before he
began to say good-night, Betty said to him
very gravely, after a painful and manifest
hesitation
“Rafe dear, there is something troubling
May I speak of it to you? May I ask
you a question ?
“My darling, there is nothing in all the
wide world that you may not say to me.”
" Thank you, Rafe dear; you are kind to
help me in what I want. Rafe, I know you
are not rich. Can you really afford to give me
so valuable a present? My love, I fear lest
my brother's taunt may have worried you.
How do you mean?” asked Rafe, for he
hardly knew what to answer.
“Rafe, you will forgive me, but perhaps
they ”—and here she laid her hand on her
bosom, wherein she had placed her lover's
gift—"may come to more than you calculated,
and indeed something cheaper will suit me as
well.”
Rafe drew a long breath. He saw a way


72
of answering without lying and without committing 
himself to the truth.
Betty dear,” he said, “the buttons are
already paid for, and with my own money-
a part of my inheritance.'
inheritance.” Then, wishing to
divert her thoughts, he started up and said- ,
Come, I shall sing you a song,” and forth-
with burst out the following in a rich baritone
voice-
“Let Gallants pledge in wine their loves
And all such other trumpery!
But faith! not I-no toasts for me-
My Heart and I are company.
In gory fields good fellows rot-
And all for love of Country !
No fields for me, save furrowed ones-
And my old Heart for company.
“ Your loves and wars alike bring tears,
And naught care I to pump any!
My quiet laugh sufficeth well-
And my old Heart for company.
“And yet, and yet when wars were on
And frightened maids would run to me,
I never shirked the blows a jot
Or shunned the maidens' company.
“Perhaps my Heart remembers well,
Adds up and reads the sum to me,
And pleasure's stores are spread again
When bygone days are company.


73.
“So pass I on my way-alone,
Till Death shall sound his trump to me.
Nor doubt I then my weary Heart
Shall find him right good company!”
Despite Rafe's resolute bearing and the
strong, masculine roundness of his voice, which
is so comforting to a woman, Betty felt full
of sadness as the last note of her lover's song
died away. Looking at him through the
dimness of her own eyes, she saw that some
subtle emotion had so wrought upon him that
his eyes too were full of tears. So she tried
to comfort him—and succeeded. The rest
of the evening was very sweetly and peacefully
happy.
When he had said good-night, not in the
ceremonious but in the usual fashion, Rafe
Otwell took himself back to his chambers in
the Temple, a man of about as desperate
fortunes, in so far as the present and the
immediate future were concerned, as any between 
London and Westminster.
It was still nearly two years to Betty's
majority, and how Rafe was to live in the
interim he did not know. The Law was ever
a waiting profession, and the Services were
denied him as he had no money and he could
therefore only join in the humblest ranks


74
moreover such would take him from Betty, the
mere thought of which he could not endure.
He had no knowledge of Commerce and no
capital to embark in it. He had thoughts,
desperate though they seemed, of asking the
advice of the Alderman ; but the remembrance
of the stern bearing of the latter made them
seem chimerical, for the old gentleman had
thought it right, as Betty's trustee, to always
assume an additional gravity in his intercourse
with the younger man. Moreover, the thought
that if the trustees should know how really
penniless he was they might forbid the marriage 
altogether, created a new fear. Rafe
was not a fortune-hunter. He loved Betty
dearly and truly, and he only regarded her
fortune in so far that it might become a help
or a bar to his happiness. Having turned in
his mind over and over again every means
of earning at least a living, and having brooded
on the difficulty, day by day and through sleepless 
nights, he made up his mind that he would
once more consult his kinsman.
When he made known to the great man his
wish to see him, he received a courteous though
curt summons, and on the afternoon of the
same day was ushered into the spacious apartment 
where Sir Robert controlled the destinies


75
of England. He had evidently given some
special orders, for on Rafe's entrance the two
secretaries, who sat before masses of State
papers, withdrew silently.
Sir Robert looked after them till he saw that
the door was shut; then he bowed to Rafe,
smiled, and pointed to a chair and sat down
himself. For a moment or two he eyed Rafe
keenly, and then, leaning over, to his intense
astonishment laid his hand on his shoulder-
a piece of condescension and familiarity which
he had never before even approached.
“Courage, kinsman,” he said kindly ; “it
is not so bad as this. You look quite woe-
begone! ’Fore Gad, Lady Mary will want
to see more sunshine, or the matter may not
be so easy as I thought.”
Rafe felt a sort of paralysis creeping over
him. Sir Robert had evidently taken it for
granted that he had made up his mind to fall
in with his scheme of marriage. He did not
know how to get out of the difficulty, and so
remained silent; his want of moral courage
had never stood him in worse stead. Walpole
went on-
"You see, I have sent away my secretaries.
This matter concerns you and me alone ; and
let me tell you this : With such an alliance


76
your fortune may yet be a greater one than
You think. You and I will be brought into
very close relations, and many secrets of State,
hidden--and of necessity most carefully—from
men so young as you are, must become known
to you. Knowledge is power, young man ;
and nowhere is it more patent than in the
world of politics. I feared from the first that
you had not sufficient ambition for public life;
but I am glad to find that my fears were false.
Moreover, I am personally well pleased that
you have fallen in with my views, for there
is none other of my kinsmen, distant or near,
that I could count on for such an alliance.
Without you one of the greatest strokes of
my life cannot be accomplished. You see I
speak frankly--more frankly perhaps than a
statesman in my position should speak; but
inasmuch as you are to fill, and very shortly,
a high office and one in close confidence with
myself, it is well that you should know it at
once.”
Here Rafe, who found that every word
uttered was putting him in a more difficult
position, tried to speak. He felt that a
confidence so given and unjustified by facts
would turn a useful friend into an implacable
enemy.


77
“Oh! sir,” he began, “your ideas of me
are not correct ; indeed they are not.”
Sir Robert smiled. “The ingenuousness
of your youth palliates the folly of your self-depreciation. 
When you enter the political
world, my dear young friend, you must put
such modesty in the lumber-room with your
childish toys. Take all you can get, and ask
for more. Never thank any one as though
you were satisfied. Be willing to assume the
responsibility of the whole Government. That
is the statesman's attitude in these troublesome
times ! Now to business. Here is your appointment 
to a secretaryship of State subject
to his Majesty's approval, and only waiting
to be dated. For this you must have a seat
in the House. This shall be done within the
week, and then, Mr. Secretary, I shall have
the honour of introducing to the Lady Mary,
under the best auspices, my young kinsman
Rafe Otwell, Member of Parliament—the rising
hope of the Whig party. Thenceforward your
fortune rests in your own hands !” Having
so spoken Sir Robert leaned back in his
chair, holding his finger-tips together with an
indescribable air of friendly patronage.
Rafe now began to grow desperate—in fact
so desperate that he straightway abandoned


78
the idea of asking for a more modest post.
He grew red and stammered, and altogether
so bore himself that the shrewd statesman
guessed his conclusion, though not the reason
of it. Standing up he said, with withering
sarcasm-
Have I then been so mistaken in you that
I have told you what I would have told no
other living man? I thought there was better
metal in you than I find there is!”
As a matter of fact he had not been mistaken
as to the metal of the man. Rafe had, like
other young men, his ambitions and adaptability ; 
and but for the fact of his engagement
to Betty, Sir Robert would have had little
difficulty in engaging him to such an enterprise.
as he contemplated. His very lack of moral
courage would have been an aid to the
ambitious statesman, who would have moulded
him to his will. For answer Rafe blurted out
the truth straightway-
“Sir, I have every desire to meet your
wishes in all ways I can. Indeed I am
in a desperate plight, and unless I can get
some place soon I am ruined; but I cannot
marry the lady you had destined for me, as
already I am betrothed to another lady."
Without a word Sir Robert rang the bell


79
that stood on his table and a servant appeared.
But in the instant a new thought had come
to the statesman, and instead of ordering
him to show Rafe out he simply gave a trivial
direction as to the time at which his chair
was to be in waiting. Sir Robert's idea was
a wise one enough, for it struck him that he
had to a degree placed himself in the young
man's power, and he knew well how, had the
circumstances been his own, he would have
availed himself of such a knowledge. This
young gentleman should perhaps be dealt with
gently! He should be encouraged to hope
for awhile, so that his intentions should have
time to manifest themselves harmlessly; and
then, if need be, he could be shelved by
presentation to some minor appointment. It
was not for nothing that the English Minister
had fixed the Civil List on the occasion of
the Hanoverian succession at £700,000 per
annum.
Sir Robert walked up and down the room
two or three times, and then stopping opposite
Rafe again regarded him intently. This
scrutiny seemed in some measure to satisfy
him, for his face cleared. After some more
turns he stopped and said, with a seeming
geniality-


80
“I will not deny that this unexpected
attitude of yours has thwarted my plans
gravely. However, we must see what can
be done. You said that without office you
would be a ruined man ; I presume therefore
that you are without friends of course I mean
friends able to help you !'
" That is so.”
“ Then you must in the meantime let me
arrest the impending ruin--from this cause
at any rate.” And then and there he wrote
an order on his banker for the sum of one
hundred guineas. As he handed this to Rafe,
he said-
“Now, of course, it is understood between
us that your acceptance of the money binds
you, were you not already bound in honour,
to keep absolutely secret the plan of your
advancement which I broached to you in
ignorance of your inability to concur with
my views. I shall try if I can obtain for you
some post to meet your permanent wants;
but I need not tell you that such posts as suit
quite neutral persons who can receive from
a party but yield nothing to it are few in
number and are much sought after. You must
husband the sum I have had the pleasure of
lending you, for months must elapse before


81
you can be suited. Indeed, I fear that there
is little hope within a year.” Then he rang
the bell again ; the servant appeared and Rafe
was dismissed with a wave of the hand.
As the door closed Sir Robert sank into his
seat with a smile upon his face such as is not as
a rule calculated, if seen by those causing it, to
beget confidence, and murmured to himself-
“We shall see! we shall see! A little
pinching of the shoe, my dear young kinsman !
A few jovial friends now and then, just to
ensure a fair amount of debt, and these I shall
make it my care to have provided for you ;
a proper spell of waiting and hoping—just
long enough to make the existing young lady,
whoever she may be and for my part I don't
want to know for I am freer to act without
such knowledge—seem a rock ahead in life.
And then another chance. Lady Mary need
not despair of a young husband yet!”
That day Rafe went down to Chelsea and
found Betty sweeter and more amiable than
ever. She was very grave and evidently had
something on her mind. When it was growing
towards the twilight she asked him to come for
a walk by the river bank, and then, when they
were quite away from the possibility of interruption, 
she opened the subject at heart.


82
“Rafe dear, you know that you and I are to
be husband and wife.” With a man's, and
especially a young man's, wish to seize the
occasion for an amatory episode, he made as
though to kiss her ; but she motioned such an
idea aside and took his hand in hers and
looked him in the face.
“No, Rafe!” she said, “I don't mean that ;
that is all true already. I mean that whatever
affects me affects you, and whatever troubles
you troubles me.”
· Yes, Betty, that is so."
“ I have been thinking, Rafe, that you may
have many expenses to meet. You will
forgive me, I know dear, for speaking of such
matters, but they must be spoken of some-
times! Must they not?
“ There is nothing, Betty, that you may not
speak of to me.
“I feel that, dear. Now, of course, when we
are married ”—here he squeezed her hand; she
blushed but did not withdraw it—"all I have
will be yours ; and then I shall be easy in my
mind, for I shall know that you have all that
you want. But I sometimes think that until
then you may have occasion for more money
than you have at your command. I know,
dear, that you are expecting a place, but


83
until that place comes you must live, and
living is expensive for young men. Oh yes,
I know. Robert proves that to me pretty
well ; and I want you to feel how glad I
should be, and how proud, if you will let me
do as I wish. You know my guardians allow
me ever so much more money than I can use.
Oh, Rafe, won't you help me out? Don't let
me have to say such things all myself. You
know what I mean."
“I do know what you mean, Betty, and I
know that you are a little angel and that I
shall never be able to be good enough for you.
Now let me tell you something. To-day I saw
Sir Robert, and he has promised me a post as
soon as he can get one for me; and in earnest
of it he has given me this ”—and opening his
pocket-book he showed her Sir Robert's order
on his bankers.
Rafe's weakness was here again manifested.
He hoped and intended to make the money last
till his marriage; and strong in the security of
his self-belief, wished to hide from Betty the
disagreeable truth of Sir Robert's proposal.
After a pause Betty said,
But, dear, this will not last for ever; and
indeed, Rafe, I feel almost jealous of Sir
Robert. He can give you what he likes"


84
But, sweetheart, this is an advance."
“And that is all that I propose.”
“But, dear, how can I explain? I cannot
take a gift. I am a gentleman ! I This is a
loan, and must be returned. It is to last me if
needs be a whole year, until I get my place.”
Betty's logical power was not sufficient to
see the fine distinction which her lover drew.
One part of it only was to her as clear daylight
—"I am a gentleman, and cannot take a
gift!” This touched some subtle chord of
honour in her own breast, and she was glad
and proud that her lover had so spoken. So
she simply said-
“I am so glad, Rafe, that my fears were
groundless. But you will forgive, will you
not? It was because I love you that I
spoke."
For answer Rafe simply lifted her hand and
kissed it. Then they went back to supper,
and Rafe was in his heart glad that he did not have
any occasion to say more of his interview with
the great Minister, or he would have had to
keep a secret from Betty.
Thus he persuaded himself; for he kept the
secret from her all the same. It was the
appearance of keeping a secret from her that
he dreaded, and not the fact.


85
Time went on happily enough with both the
young people for a few months. They both
had hope and they loved each other; and
under such conditions life goes smoothly
enough and evils that are not vital are not
hard to bear. It was at this time of quiet, easy-
going prosperity that the difference of the
two natures became most apparent. Betty
developed new and finer phases of character.
Always thoughtful, she now became blessed
with a sweet gravity—that gravity which so
becomes the wife potential, the one whose
self is forgotten in the needs of others. She
also became more tolerant. True the stern
rule of right and wrong which she had set
for herself was never relaxed, and the standard
of Duty was ever before her, her pillar of cloud
by day and of fire by night. She more than
once sent money unasked to Robert, and when
his brief career was cut short by the rapier of
his antagonist she had all the debts which he
owed, and they were many, paid without ever
even appearing in the matter. At this sad
time Rafe was of much comfort to her, and the
truly generous and manly side of his character
never came out better than in the way he
spoke of the dead man and did all in his power
to mitigate the grief of his half-sister.


86
But the period of rest or quiescence told not
favourably on Rafe's character. The need of
thought and the fear of consequences being out
of the range of his immediate vision, he began
to get more careless. His imagination began to
run away with him ; everything was
of such rosy colour that it seemed hard or
impossible to believe that it could change. He
did not husband his small means as he should
have done; and one day he woke to the fact
that of Walpole's loan not a fifth part remained.
Then he grew careful, but not quite in a
satisfactory way. True that he husbanded
his resources ; but it was only ready money
that he was careful about. He got into debt
and found, as others do, that debt is an expensive 
process and that one does not get full
money's worth for the promise of money—that
it is not possible to go minutely into questions
of cost when we are not prepared to pay.
Thus it happened that when, some three
months after his last interview, he got a
summons from his powerful kinsman he was
down almost to his last shilling.
The interview was not altogether a pleasant
one. Sir Robert was much more courteous
than on the former occasion. He asked him
a number of questions as to his prospects, and


87
seemed generally to look on him as a man on
whom time was exerting a requisite pressure.
Rafe felt this and it galled him ; but he did not
dare to find fault, for his affairs were now in
such a plight that his only hope was in the
patronage of his powerful kinsman. He felt
that he had in his selfish carelessness thrown
away the advantage which had been put into
his hand. Sir Robert gently, and as if
casually, alluded to the fact that the Lady
Mary's hand was still unwon. He might have
added "unsought,” but this excess of candour
was no part of his programme. He very soon
made up his mind that Rafe was not yet at all
events ripe for his scheme ; and after mentioning
the circumstance of his former debt in such a
way as to impress his hearer of iron possibilities
in his nature if he should be a hostile creditor,
sat down and drew a draft on his banker for
fifty guineas. This he handed to Rafe with all
protestations of goodwill.
Rafe was at first a little more careful with
this money ; but very soon the logic of his
careless nature began to assert itself. This
second rescue was unexpected; therefore other
unexpected things might happen. What can
be more fallacious than to depend on, and
expect, the unexpected! It never occurred to


88
him that the unexpected things might happen
in opposite direction to his wish. Once or
twice he brought trilling presents to Betty,
little inexpensive things which she received
with delight, frankly telling him that she was
glad to see he was prudent. It is always a
delight to a woman to get presents from the
man she loves; and these things, since unaccompanied 
by any fear, made Betty very
happy.
So another couple of months elapsed ; and
then a great temptation began to assail Rafe.
His means were down at the lowest ebb.
His credit was running low and he feared
daily, hourly, lest wind of such should get to
Betty or her guardians. He had a sort of
feeling that Sir Robert had him in his power
and meant to mould him to his will. He was
now so tangled in various ways that he could
see no opening anywhere. Betty had offered
him her purse, but he had told her that a
gentleman could not accept a gift. Sir Robert
held out hopes of all his ambition could dream
of. Debt pressed him on every side, and a
debtors' prison was not a place to be yearned
for in the early days of King George. Such
legal study as he had had taught him that
much. What if, after all, he should be compelled



89
to fall into Sir Robert's plans ? It
would be well enough except for one thing
Betty. No! he could not bear the thought of
parting from her or of giving her up. Should
he go and tell her his dilemma? He knew
well that she would help him and forgive him.
But then such would involve his telling her a
whole host of other matters which he had kept
concealed, and so he might lose her esteem and
appear in her eyes as one who did not tell—or
who hesitated to tell—the truth. His pride, or
vanity, would not allow of this.
Whilst thus pondering he got a hurried line
from Sir Robert asking him to call on him, this
time at his private house. He went at once
and was kept waiting for some time in the
ante-room. During his wait many persons
kept coming and going, and he could easily
see that there was some excitement in the air.
At last he was summoned, and found Sir
Robert alone in the midst of a chaos of torn
papers. The Minister motioned him to take a
seat, and then plunged into his subject--
'I have sent for you, not this time on my
own account but on yours. To-day I send in
my seals”–Rafe's heart sank within him ; his
hopes were gone—" but I have still a thought
for you. You can answer me 'yes' or 'no'


90
just as you wish, the choice is now your own.
If you will choose to wed the Lady Mary your
future, whatever may happen, is secured ; and
if it should be that I return again to power the
highest honours can be yours. Quick! make
your choice, for time presses. If you say 'yes
I shall aid you with my purse to make a fit and
proper appearance for the sake of our kinship.
If not—"he paused, and Rafe, with all the
firmness he could muster, answered-
“ Not!"
“In that case, my young friend, you may go
to the devil. I don't suppose he is so busy today 
as I am, and may have time to make terms to suit you.
Good-day!”


CHAPTER V
IN THE DEAD WATCH OF THE NIGHT
EVERAL weeks elapsed before Rafe
again called at Cheyne Walk. Betty
got a letter from him saying that he had to
go to the North on some family business, but
that so soon as he returned he would come and
gladden his eyes with the sight of her sweet
face; with much other matter of the same
kind, tedious to third parties. The early
Georgian love-letter was of much the same
tone and tendency as that of earlier—and of
later-years; and its recipient gave it the
same sweet and trustful welcome as was usual
before—and after--that epoch.
Whilst Rafe was away Betty busied herself
about household matters and in works of
charity ; began to think of her housekeeping
when her majority should have come, and
other things should have happened. So the


92
time sped by quickly enough, and it did not
seem so very long to look back upon when
Rafe appeared at the door. Betty flew to meet
him, and no lover, however exacting, need have
been disappointed with the warmth of her
greeting. When they reached the drawing-room, 
a measure of decorum having been
restored and they holding each other's hands,
Betty held him at arms' length and gazed at
him lovingly. He seemed taller and more
robust, but there was something about him, she
could hardly say what it was, that disappointed
her. All his timidity in her presence seemed
gone, and there was something boisterous—
reckless-she knew not what to call it—which
certainly she had never before noticed. All
this was, of course, vague and shadowy. To
say she thought it would be hardly correct,
for the idea was spontaneous and evanescent.
It was rather a food for afterthought than
thought itself. But whether such thoughts
were on solid base or baseless as the air, they
did not disturb Betty's happiness. Rafe was
home again, and she was content! She half
hoped that after a while he would tell her
something of his journey, or of why he went
away, and where he went to and what he saw,
and whom he met, and his adventures—for of


93
course he had adventures. But Rafe did not
touch on such topics, and Betty feared to ask
him lest he should think it inquisitive to speak
of things that he himself had not thought right
to mention.
Had she had a mother it would have been
different, for the mother would have known
the wishes of her child and would have so
wrought the conversation that the betrothed
girl's most natural curiosity should have been
satisfied. As the evening wore on there were
several little shocks to Betty's delicate trust,
her very ignorance making shadowy fears.
Before he left Rafe put his hand in his
pocket and took out a little box, which he
handed to Betty and told her he hoped she
would value it for his sake. Betty took it with
joy in her face and kissed him, before Aunt
Priscilla too, and told him how sweet it was of
him to remember her when he was away. But
when she opened the box and found a little
pair of diamond buckles lying on the white silk
that lined the box, her face grew very grave,
and she said, in a voice not without reproval-
No, Rafe dear, I cannot accept so valuable
a present. You have not got your place yet,
and it would ill become me who love you to be
the means or the motive of such extravagance.


94
Dear, you will let me keep this box, will you
not? But take these,” and she handed him
back the buckles. He did not attempt to force
them upon her, but put them in his pocket with
a light laugh that somewhat jarred upon her.
When he had taken leave she ran up to
her own room and, raising a tiny corner of the
curtain, watched her lover as he walked away.
To her surprise he did not go in the usual
direction towards Swan Walk so as to gain the
King's Road, where he was accustomed to
leave his horse, but walked with head down
towards the river bank.
He stood there a moment and then put his
hand into his pocket, and taking out something
therefrom hurled it with an angry gesture far
into the river. Betty saw a white flash in the
moonlight as the water was struck, and then
as Rafe strode angrily away she dropped the
curtain and slipped away quickly and went to
bed in the dark. With her head under the
bedclothes she sobbed herself to sleep.
Rafe came every day that week to see her, and
as the time wore on he came back nearer and
nearer to his old self. There was still a certain
masculine dominance in his manner; but to this
she did not object. What woman ever did
object to such a quality in her lover? It was


95
sweet to be asked to do things, but in such
manner that the doing was expected as a matter
of course; but sweeter still to be told rather
than asked to do anything, but in a way which
did not wound.
Things seemed to have prospered somehow
of late with Rafe. His clothes were of the
very finest, though this alone was not strange,
for he was always somewhat of a dandy. But
he now had a barge and a wherry all of his
own—very spruce ones too, with his men in his
own livery; and when he rode down, which was
pretty often, he was always splendidly mounted.
These things gave Betty many a pang, for she
feared he might have been getting into debt or
gambling, and either supposition was pain to
her. She did not like to broach the subject,
but fondly hoped that some day, not far off,
Rafe would take her into his full confidence.
But as days and weeks wore on it became
evident to her that Rafe had no such intention.
Sometimes he would be absent for two or three
days, and when he came there would be some-
thing of that new self-assertive manner which
she partly disliked and partly feared; but after
a few days this would all wear away and he
became more the old Rafe again.
One day Alderman Fenton came to drink a


96
dish of tea with Betty and Aunt Priscilla, and
afterwards took his cousin out for a walk along
by the river bank. Here, after some preliminary 
hum-ing and ha-ing, for the subject was
a difficult one, he began to speak of Rafe and
his doings.
“My dear,” he said, “I thought I'd better
come and speak to you first, for I feared I
might make some trouble if I did the wrong
thing. You won't be angry with me, Betty,
will you?”
Betty's heart sank within her, for she
dreaded some confirmation of her fears;
nevertheless she answered lightly-
I promise you, cousin, that whatever it is
you tell me, I shall not be angry with you. I
know that whatever you think for me is out of
your kindness."
“That's true, Betty, my dear. Quite true!
I have no chick or child of my own, and all the
care I have in the world is for you. Now I
want to talk about this young gentleman of
yours.
“About Rafe, cousin ?” she interrupted.
The old gentleman pinched her cheek as he
answered
“Who else, puss? There's only one that I
know of!”


97
“Or I either !” she answered demurely, with
a sweet, half shy, half arch, and wholly adorable
upward look at him.
“ Well! I have been minded many times of
late to go and talk with him about matters.
You see, from what I am told, he's taken to
more extravagant ways than he had ; keeps
more company, and ruffles about with all the
young bloods in the town ; boats, horses, and
all the rest of it; and draws his sword as readily
as may be. Wherever there is money being
spent there he is, spending with the best of
them. Nay, he seems to keep all companies ;
for he sits also in the taverns and coffee-houses
with the merchants and adventurers and talks
much with them. He is quite clever too ; and
that is part of the pity of it, for with his
knowledge of what is going to happen,
gathered from statesmen and secretaries and
young gallants and old merchants, he might
make a fortune in no time. But alack! he
prefers to royster with the bloods of the town.
“I am very sorry, cousin, to hear this,”
faltered poor Betty with her face as white as
a sheet.
“And not more sorry than I am to tell you,
my dear,” said the old gentleman, more moved
than he thought possible by the sight of the


98
maid's silent distress, “and if it lay with me
such ill tidings would never come a-nigh you ;
but I have thought the matter over for some
time, and I have concluded that the least harmful 
thing I could do would be to consult you.
You see, my dear,” he added confidentially,
"young men of his kind are not like us plain
city folk, and have their own proud ideas and
their own quick-tempered ways; and as for us,
we don't quite understand either of them. I'm
often minded to think that the sweeping out of
the shop which we have had to do in our
'prentice days is a mighty chastening exercise
for the spirit. It somehow makes us think
more of our work and less of ourselves, than
the breeding of these young gallants teaches
them.”
After a little pause the old gentleman went
on, but very gently and suppressing all his
personal feelings, for he was touched deeply by
the maid's white face-
“So the other day I made opportunity to speak
with him ; and as I thought so old a man as I
might take such a liberty with a younger one,
I began by offering, though I fear but clumsily,
to be of such service as an old man and a
London merchant might with his advice or his
purse."


99
Here Betty interrupted a moment by an
eloquent, grateful look and a squeeze of her
hand; the old man smiled and spoke more
cheerfully as he went on-
“At the first, my dear, I did think that he was
grateful, for there was a look in his face that
you would have loved to see there; but an
instant after it was lost in a very sad look-a
white, sad look, my dear, that made me think
that he has some trouble that he is bearing all
by himself. My heart opened to him as though
he was a boy of my own. It was partly for
your sake, Betty, and I was in hopes that hereafter 
he and I might be more to each other.
But in an instant after he broke out into a hard
laugh that dried me up like a touch of the east
wind and he said, as coolly and as insolently
as ever I heard words spoke, but, my dear, with
all his own elegance of word and manner :
* Thank you much, good sir, but when I want
advice or money I shall not fail to apprise you
of the fact.' I suppose he saw my disappointment 
in my face, for after a pause he said: Do
not think me rude or ungrateful, dear sir,
but in such matters I am apt to be proud and
hard. I have so long had to advise myself
and to provide for my wants in my own way,
that I am perhaps too wishful to stand alone


100
and to continue in my own course.' And so,
Betty, sure I am that the young man has some
trouble that he wraps up in his pride away
from the eyes of others; and so I am come to
advise with you."
Both were silent for a little while. Betty
had now taken the old gentleman's arm and
was leaning on it heavily enough. Poor child !
her knees seemed to have grown weak, and it
was a comfort to her to have something to lean
on in her distress. Presently she said-
" What can I do, cousin ? What can I
do?"
“I thought that so gay and gallant a
young gentleman would listen with more
patience to so sweet a young lady as you
are, and whom he loves so fondly”—Betty
was grateful for this, though she doubted the
Alderman's sincerity in making the statement,
and smiled at him as he went on—“ than he
did to an old merchant like myself. These
young bloods seem to forget that we are men
like themselves, and that we feel passion even
if we do not show it, or wear swords with the
intention of using them on our kind.”
Betty could not but feel that the successful
man of business had a little class jealousy
rankling in his mind, and somehow it raised


ΙΟΙ
Rafe in her esteem. She did not, of course,
show any of the feeling ; indeed, she was too
distressed to show any feeling but the one-
her concern regarding Rafe. Alderman Fenton
went on-
“You know, my dear, that when your engagement 
was told us, we trustees made
inquiries, and found that Mr. Otwell had
realised his patrimony and had come into the
Temple ; so now when he spends money in
the way he does I cannot but think that
there is something wrong. There is so much
gambling nowadays, and so many young men
like him fling away their fortunes over the
dice that maybe he picks up some of what
their folly loses. In any case it is but a
poor thing; and if it be so, we had better
look to it lest the happiness of your life be
thrown away. A gambler, my dear, is but a
sorry mate for such a girl as you."
Again Betty's heart seemed to stop. Here
was almost a confirmation of her worst fears,
but, hoping against hope, she pleaded once
more for her lover-
“Oh! I trust this is not so. It cannot be !
May not there be some other way, cousin, by
which Rafe can get such money as he
spends ? "


102
“There may,” said the merchant. " He
can borrow money. There are sharks who
prey on the needs of youngsters like him,
and lend a little that they may take back a
deal. But the debtors' prison lies that way.
Nay! Betty, my dear, do not be frightened !
Sit ye down awhile. There, dear heart, you
are all right now. Why, rather than see him
in a prison I would for your sake pay away half
my fortune. I fear, my dear, that I have
done wrong to tell you so much ; but, truth
to tell, I did not know which way to turn.'
Before Betty's eyes had all along been the
face of her lover as he had refused her offer
of help: "I cannot take a gift ; I am a
gentleman!” She thought that she understood 
Rafe's pride, and how it dominated him
in his interview with the Alderman, in whose
eyes he wished, of course, for her sake, to
appear at his best; and in her eyes his pride
was his best. So she answered the old man
very tenderly-
Indeed, cousin, you have done quite right.
I will find out these things direct on the next
occasion that may be; and then I will consult
with you. You will forgive me being so—so
weak, .will you not? I do not feel very strong
lately. I think I want change of air, and shall


103
presently go to Much Hadam and rest awhile.
The air there always seems to do me good.”
“My dear girl, I am sure you want a
change. But you must be careful how you
go; these quiet times seem to have grown
a new crop of highwaymen, and but few of
our roads are safe. Indeed, the Cambridge
road seems infested, for of late there have
been many daring robberies; and when you
go through Essex and Hertford you must
be more than careful."
“Oh, I don't fear highwaymen, cousin, It
is not people like me whom they stop; they
prefer your rich city folk whose purses are
like those of the Fortunate Prince !"
Thus they talked and rallied each other,
and came back to the house in a somewhat
less unhappy frame of mind; but Betty's
face was still white and drawn.
It was nearly a week after this evening
that Rafe paid Betty a visit; and then he
was in one of his most aggressive moods.
His under eyelids looked somewhat swollen,
and with a pang Betty came to the conclusion
that he had taken a part in some drinking
bout. Drunkenness did not in those days
inspire such disgust in refined womankind
as it did later on; but still the change in


104
Rafe seemed all downward and not upward.
Betty, however, was very resolute when her
mind was made up, and notwithstanding that
Rafe's mood was not one she would have
chosen in which to attack him upon the
subject of his faults, she steadfastly adhered to
her intention. At the earliest moment when
they were alone she began her task-
“Rafe, I want you to tell me something.
You must not make light of it, for I am
very serious and have of late had much
unquiet in my mind about you.”
Rafe's face turned a sort of livid green ; he
answered, however, boldly enough, although
the ring of his voice was loud rather than
true : “All right, Betty dear! Go on; I am
all attention.”
Face to face with the difficulty, Betty's
hardihood began to melt away.
to melt away. Her heart
beat fast, and she had that trembling of the
knees that had of late come to her on such
occasions. Nevertheless she did not falter,
but went on with outward calm-
It is because I love you, Rafe! Re-
member, dear, that we are soon to be
married, and I shall then have a right to
ask you such questions. You will let me
forestall that time, won't you?'


105
“What questions?” Rafe's voice was rather
hollow.
'I want you to tell me, dear, two things.
I know you have recently been spending
much money, and I know you had lately
but very little. Do you gamble, Rafe? or
are you in debt ? "
The words were spoken with a shy, sweet
sincerity that should have melted the heart
of any man. It was all out now, and the
hardihood was quite gone. Betty felt it
was well she was sitting down and could
lean back, or else she might have fallen to
the floor. To her surprise and joy Rafe
laughed, though she did not quite like the
tone of the laugh, and said heartily and
with a sort of boisterous buoyancy-
'Neither the one nor the other, little one.
See here! that for my owing money!” and
he opened a pocket-book and showed her
quite a handful of gold and bankers' orders.
"And as for gambling, I swear I have not
touched the dice since I knew you."
Betty drew a long breath, and was just
beginning to follow up these answers with
another question as to where he got the money
he spent; but he saw it coming and stopped it
with an irritated protest-


106
“More questions! Why, what can have
come over you, Betty? You used not to be
like this. Come! you think too much of my
affairs, and the thinking has robbed the roses
from your cheeks. As a punishment I here
promise and vow that I shall not answer you
any more questions concerning money till I
can hold you in my arms and call you mine.”
“I am yours already, Rafe!” said Betty
simply; but she turned the conversation and
asked no more questions.
When Rafe was going away that night he
told Betty that it would be some days before
he could come again as he had to await certain
dispatches coming through Portsmouth. “A
private affair,” he added, seeing new questions
In her eyes. So Betty said good-night and
went to bed, hoping that some day Rafe would
give her all his confidence.
A few days after this the Alderman paid
a visit to Cheyne Walk. He was concerned
about Betty's health, and wanted to cheer her
up a bit. So he paid a long visit, staying
for supper, and told her all the news of the
town. How the new waterworks of the New
River and the Lea were progressing, and how
good this was for her, since her trustee held
for her some adventurers' shares in the under-


107
taking, and of the great moneys being spent
on the works and the many men employed.
He explained to her how every Saturday a
great sum had to be sent down from London
to pay the men ; but as they feared the pay-master 
might be traced and robbed the Board
had determined to send the next consignment
of money on the Friday evening to Ware, and
to send it by a roundabout way through
Bishop's Stortford so as to avoid the danger,
and by a messenger who could not be suspected.
In fact he hinted that the messenger would
be disguised as a woman. Then seeing that
such talk upset her a little he turned the
conversation, and, so well as he could, he told
her of the new fashions; for he had made it
his business to have a chat with the Lady
Mayoress only the day before, so that he would
be properly learned in such matters. And then
he told her of all the Court gossip that had
reached the city, and of the great marriages
arranged, and all the presents given; of the
quarrels amongst the bloods, and who had
fought whom, and the thousand and one little
pieces of everyday gossip which were so much
to quiet folk in the days before newspapers.
Finally he told her of the great robbery
two days before, when the coach from Portsmouth


108
mouth was stopped at Ockham with great
treasure being brought up to London from my
Lord Baltimore for the Southern Department.
That it was a most daring robbery, for the
highwayman was alone and rode so boldly and
carried himself so fearlessly that all in the
coach were awed and yielded to him without
firing a shot. Then he went on to tell her
how the robber had left the coachman and the
guard and all the passengers bound, so that
it was not until many hours afterwards that
they were discovered and released by the down
mail. That the authorities were on the alert,
and that the hue and cry was out for the
robber, and that if he were caught it would
be a sorry case for him. And as he told her
the story Betty's heart went out in thankfulness 
that no lives were lost; and above all
one life most dear to her, for it might have
been that Rafe was in that very coach.
Had it so been, then for sure the robber had
not got off full-handed or without a fight for
it. And as she thought of her lover's peril
she grew so pale, and as she thought of his
courage—for could she ever forget that day on
the river !—she grew so rosy again that her
elderly cousin rubbed his hands with delight at
his success as a story-teller, and said to her-


109
"Hey Betty, my lass, but you've got white
and red like the apple and the candle twirling
at Halloween. You take such things too much
to heart, my dear. It can't be good for you
to be so earnest over things that don't touch
you or yours.
So Betty, she being a little shamefaced
about her great love which made such fears,
was silent about Rafe, and thanked her
cousin for all his kind interest in her and for
all his entertaining conversation, and bade him
come again soon. The stern old Alderman,
when his carriage came round for him, rode
back to town again, pleased that he had come,
but sad at heart that he had not just such
another daughter to gladden his hearth and to
keep his heart and memory green.
When next Rafe came he was in great
spirits, and spoke of the time, drawing closer,
when he was to call Betty his own. There
was a jubilation about him which was infectious,
and Betty's spirits rose with his; when they
were alone she sat at the spinet and played
and sang the sweet old airs that she loved ; but
he sat very silent the while. The dusk came
on, and the shadows of the evening fell heavier
and heavier. At the spinet Betty still sat,
with her white dress showing through the


110
gathering gloom ; Rafe, on a low chair, bent
his head down on his knees and lost himself
in thought, so that when Betty's hands moved
slower and slower over the keys and her voice
died away in a deep, low chord in which spoke
the happiness and the hope of her heart, he
never stirred. Then Betty came closer to him
and laid her hand on his head. He started up
suddenly, like one who is hunted and stands
at his defence, with an oath on his lips and his
hand instinctively seeking his sword-hilt. Betty
was somewhat afraid, but her fears were laid
when she saw that his cheeks were wet with
tears. She would like to have said something
very tender and sweet to him, but he brushed
the tears aside so angrily and seemed so savage
with himself—though not with her—for his
forgetfulness, that she thought it better not
to take notice of his emotion. But he was not
the same Rafe any more that evening. His
buoyancy became boisterous, though of an
indifferent kind, and Betty closed the spinet ;
she sang no more that night. Before he
left Rafe told her that he would come again
in four days—that he could not come before
as he had an engagement that must take him
towards Cambridge, but that when this engagement 
was over he hoped to come oftener;


111
every day, till the time would come when they
should part no more. Altogether the evening,
despite its unpleasant episode, was a very, very
happy one for Betty, and when going to bed
she remained a long time on her knees in
thankfulness and prayer, and fell asleep thinking
of Rafe and the coming time.
What Betty dreamed that night she could
never remember. It seemed to be that her
sleeping thoughts had at first been happy
enough, but that such dreams as she had were
not all about Rafe.
Suddenly, however, she
found herself broad awake, sitting up in bed
with her hair damp with terror and a scream
frozen on her lips. It was as though all her
vague thoughts of months past had suddenly
become clear that her fears had found their
source, and that henceforth there was nothing
more left in the world that could give her new
pain. And that source-Rafe!
“Rafe!
She understood now his determination ; his
growing restlessness; whence came the money
he lavished so freely. She pieced together the
fragments of her fears on each occasion when
her lover had gone away, and when he had
returned. She understood now the motive of
that visit to the North, and of that “private


112
affair” which had taken him along the Portsmouth 
road at such a fatal time; and with a
terror and pain unspeakable she realised the
import of that coming journey towards Cambridge 
when the treasure of the New River
Company was to be taken to Ware by way of
Bishop's Stortford which was on the Cambridge
road. All had come to her as if revealed in
a moment, as one sees through after years of
blindness the figures standing stark in the last-
seen terrible glare of the lightning-flash. She
wondered how she could ever have been so
blind as not to have seen all long ago; for
there was no doubt now, and it seemed to her,
in the anguish of her excited mind, that there
never had been any.
She would have given worlds to have been
able to confide her troubles to any one ; but
such a thing was impossible—no human being
must ever know. The horror and the shame
must be hers alone; and further evil must be
averted at all cost. There was no doubt in
her mind; no Aickering ash of a hope. No
voice of the unseen could persuade her that
her conclusion was untrue. · Would to God it
were!” she thought, in a blind anguish. Ah
no! it was all so clear, as though written in
fire on the wall by that same hand which of


113
old had swept the gaiety from Belshazzar's
feast.
Betty rose and knelt beside her bed. She
threw her white arms stretched out in front of
her and hid her face in the snowy napery. She
prayed till her eyes seemed full of fire and
she thought that her heart would break with
anguish. Clasping her hands above her head
she looked up as though her vision could pierce
through the roof and the sky beyond so that
God Himself might see her anguish and have
pity on her and send her help. But these wild
bursts of passionate prayer gave no sensible
relief; her arms fell by her side, and her sweet
face lay on the white counterpane like snow on
snow, till the light of the morning stealing 
in through the curtains of her chamber
window caught the beautiful Greek lines of her
profile and lit the deep, earnest eyes with the
resolve of action that comes with the waking
day.
Betty did not realise it then, but perhaps for
all she knew her silent cry of anguish did
pierce through the roof and sky and come as a
sweeter gift than any burnt offering before the
Throne of the Most High. The burnt offering
of charred flesh is poor indeed before the
renunciation of the soul that pain has burned


114
and purified and made a worthy gift to the
Creator of mankind !
“ Thou delightest not in burnt offerings.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit ; a
broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt Thou
not despise."


CHAPTER VI
PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
IN the long vigil of that night Betty's
course was resolved upon. She seemed to
see her duty clear before her. She would go
forth herself and reclaim the man she loved-
the man whose heart seemed to beat in her
own breast and who carried with him all her
love. Unworthy though he had proved, she
loved him still; and as even he had given her
life to her, so if need be should that life be
given for him in return. She thought over the
whole matter; and as she thought, the way
seemed to open to her. Every detail of the
coming trial rose before her mind, so that
ultimately she was satisfied as to where she
should go, what she should do, and how she
should bear herself so as to keep her purpose
hidden.


116
It was now the morning of Wednesday, and
no time was to be lost. When she came down
to breakfast her aunt noticed how pale she was
and was much concerned for her. As a rule
Betty did not yield to small ills but turned
them aside and battled through them in her
own quiet way; but to-day she acquiesced in
the alarm of her aunt. The latter said presently-
“You must have change of air, Betty. I
will write to my sister at Much Hadam and
tell her to prepare for us; and next week we
will go there to stay for a month or two."
To which Betty replied-
Oh! Aunt Priscilla, I have been longing to
see the dear old house and the trees and all.
I know it will do me so much good. I want
to go at once ; let us go to-day.'
“ Lord-a-mercy child !” said the elder lady,
“how can we go at once, when I have arranged
for Monday to have the painters here to choose
the colours for the repainting?
Then let me go, aunt! I am sick to go.”
“How could you go alone, child ?”
“Why, aunt,”—and Betty smiled—“it is only
a part of a day's ride. I shall take Robin with
with me, and shall stay the night with Cousin
Hester at Finsbury Square. I can then do


117
some shopping, and go in the morning to
Much Hadam."
“I fear to let you go all alone, my child.
Remember all these terrible things of footpads
and highwaymen, that have been going on of
late."
“Not more than usual, aunt! Those wicked
folk have never ceased their ways that I have
heard tell of. But I have no fear of footpads
or highwaymen, and we go an open way with
many travellers to Bishop's Stortford. Thence
it is only a step, and through byways where
it is never worth a highwayman's while to stop.
He would starve for all the travellers there!”
Aunt Priscilla was not convinced ; but she saw
no way to an effective answer, so she said-
“Well, as you will, child! But when would
you go?”
“I thought in the morning.”
“Dear me! dear me! but that leaves little
time to prepare."
But, aunt, I want to go! My mind is made
up, and it will fret me if I am disappointed.”
This settled the matter. Aunt Priscilla
looked at the sweet, pale face, and came over
and kissed her, and said-
“Please God, dear, the change will do you
good. You shall have your wish, and go in the


118
morning,” and she hurried off to consult with
Abigail as to the preparation of Betty's valise.
Though she had conciliated her aunt, Betty
was not yet free from domestic obstruction-
Abigail had still to be reckoned with ; but this
she expected and was prepared for. With the
freedom and directness of an old servant,
Abigail entered on her task. She burst into
the room, almost at the charge, and began-
“What's all this nonsense, Miss, that Miss
Priscilla tells me about your going to Much
Hadam all by yourself, and all at once, like
this, without a stitch of clothes to your back
ready, and not so much as a valise even aired !
What are things coming to, I wonder?—though
why should I wonder, when young ladies nowadays 
do just as they like and as their mothers
wouldn't have ventured to have done in my
time? and why should you keep such a thing
in your mind away from the nurse that loved
and reared you and took you from the arms of
your dear dead mother and did for you ever
since? And now you put this on her that she
don't know no more of your movements and
intentions than the maids themselves. I'm
astonished at you, Miss Betty! That I am,
sure and true; and sorry I am this day!”
and the good soul burst out into tears,



119
refusing for a while to be comforted. Betty had
let her run on till she had said her say, for this
she knew to be not merely the wisest but the
only plan. Now she made her answer in her
own way. The beginning was purely pacific.
She went over to Abigail and put her arms
round her and nestled close to her, and with
her own pocket-handkerchief wiped away her
tears. This Abigail resented at the first, and
then wouldn't allow, saying sobbingly that she
wasn't worthy to have her eyes dried by her
young mistress-a young lady that was so
great that she couldn't see any differ betwixt 
the maids and them that had to keep
them in order. But Betty persevered, and the
summer shower was soon past. Then Betty
made her sit down, and sat on her knee and
asked her if she remembered when she, Betty,
was a little child and used to come and sit on
her, Abigail's, knee and be comforted. So
what could the old woman do but hug her
close to her, and tell her again how well she
recalled those days ? And then, remembering
to be depressed at something, she added that
such times were all past now, and that young
children had grown up to be fine ladies, and
made as though to put her off her knees and
to rise respectfully—but all the time holding


120
her tighter than ever. So Betty put her face
against hers and said,
"Abigail, I am a little child again, and I
want to go away in the morning. Long ago,
when I wanted anything and was denied it, I
came to you ; and you never denied me. And
now when I want to go in the morning, and to
go peacefully, for I am feeling ill and in low
spirits, and will be miserable if I leave you all
discontented behind me, I ask you, Abigail, to
help me again! You must help me, dear, and 
Cheer me up. Look at me, Abigail, and let
my old nurse say if I am not ill and do not
want a change.” So Abigail looked, and suddenly 
caught her in her arms and told her how
her poor, pale face made her miserable ; and
that she should go away that very hour if she
wished it, if she, Abigail, had to work her
fingers to the very bone to enable her to do so.
And so the old accord was established, and one
more willing heart and two more willing hands
aided in all love in furthering Betty's wishes.
All that day Betty went as one in a dream-
that is, so far as her own conscious thought was
concerned, for to all the others she was as
usual, only that there was an added sweetness
in her every act and thought. To-day everything 
with her was an impulse, a spontaneous


121
carrying out of a settled purpose---something
already ordained and quite outside herself.
Part of the day she spent in the drawing-room
busy at her escretoire, reading old letters and
tearing up many of them, the pieces of which
she afterwards burned. Now and then she sat
at the spinet and sang over some of the old
songs that she loved, and that Rafe said he
liked to hear ; but they gave her no pain now,
and though she sang all the most touching of
them she did not shed a tear. Last of all her
work in the drawing-room, she wrote out a
paper, very short and evidently the result of
much thought. This she sealed carefully and
put away in an interior drawer which had a
lock of its own. In her bedroom she went
through her dresses with Abigail and chose out
a few, a very few, to carry in her valise ; the
rest she said were to follow when Aunt Priscilla 
and Abigail came on to Much Hadam.
In the afternoon she laid down for awhile and
slept; in the cool of the evening she went out
for a walk by herself on the river bank. One
by one she visited all the spots associated in
her mind with Rafe; the place above the Swan
Inn where he had saved her life, and then
where he had helped her on shore ; the little
peninsula where the great trees grew, where


122
they had walked and sat and exchanged thoughts
and silences; and the grove of trees near the
marshes where he had given her the gold but-
tons with the legend that she so loved wrought
on them. Here she remained for a long time,
standing still as if carved out of stone. The
red glare of the sunset fell full upon her
smiting her pale face and snowy garments till
from head to foot she looked as if dipped in
blood. Her thoughts were very peaceful ; her
mind was made up, and all that remained to
her was the doing of her task.
And so once again the sun dropped into the
far reaches of the river beyond the marshes,
and the silver and gold of the stream and pools
grew grey in the shadows of the evening, and
the chill of the coming night crept over the
river and its banks ; and Betty went home.
Abigail had tested for supper that evening
all the powers of the kitchen. She had determined 
that Miss Betty should not lack choice
of such things as she generally liked, so that
there was a rare display of tasty dishes on the
table. Betty tried to acknowledge her thoughtfulness, 
and took from many of the dishes; and
so, although feeling no relish for her food, made
in the end a hearty meal. Then she said goodnight 
to her aunt and thanked her for all her


123
goodness, and also Abigail, till the two elderly
women thought that she was getting afraid of
the journey before her, and once more urged
her to wait or to have a proper escort. But
she laughed their doubts aside and told them
she had no fear ; that she only said goodbye
at all because she was going on a journey and
should have to leave them even for a short
time. All at once Abigail asked-
“ But when Master Rafe comes, Miss Betty,
what am I to tell him?"
To which she answered
“Of course you will tell him that I have
gone to Much Hadam to rest awhile and have
change of air, and that if he should see well
to ride down, my Aunt Edith will be most
delighted—and that I shall be glad too !” and
Betty slipped away to her room and locked her
door.
Then she opened the valise that Abigail had
so carefully packed, and took out one of the
dresses that was ready in it—a beautiful dress
of figured Italian silk. This she put away in
one of the wardrobes, under some other clothes,
so that Abigail's sharp eyes should not notice
it at once, and in its stead she packed the white
lawn dress which she had worn that day on the
river when Rafe had rescued her. It had been

124
so carefully washed that it was just as it had been
and as fair as then. She made two other additions 
to the mail, hiding them amongst the
things already packed lest some chance should
reveal them. One was the box containing the
gold buttons, and the other a short, sharp dagger
in a shagreen sheath which had always used to
lie on the dressing-table of her great-grandfather
to serve, if required, as an arm against thieves.
Lastly, she made the packing complete so that
only a few toilet articles used in the morning
would have to be added before the time for
strapping up came. Then having undressed,
she knelt and prayed for a long, long time, and
arose and went to bed, where she at once fell
asleep and slept well all through the night.
All this time she appeared to have no concern,
no mental disturbance or perturbation of any
kind, and there never seemed to come into her
mind even the shadow of a doubt as to Rafe.
Truly the intuition of a woman is a divine
thing, and complete with the calm perfection of
things beyond earth. Each act of the day
seemed to have its definite and fore-appointed
plan—to be part of a scheme of things already
arranged. When she slept she lay with her
hands meekly folded over her breast, just as a
saint or a martyr-who is the best of saints-


125
is represented in stone. Very sweet and very
pure she looked, and the pallor and repose of
her face seemed like peaceful death ; the white
drapery of her bed lay in classic folds to suit
the antique beauty of her profile. Only the
golden brown hair, which Praxiteles himself
could not have chiselled, the eyelids drooped
in sleep, and the gently heaving bosom, showed
her to belong to the real world and not already
to the land of dreams.
She awoke with the first ray of sunrise which
stole into the room, and after praying long and
earnestly and having made her toilet, finished
the packing of her valise. Then she strapped
it ready for travel, so that when Abigail came
up herself earlier than had been intended,
that there should be nothing left undone which
her young mistress should want, she was
amazed to find her ready for the journey.
“Dear heart !” she ejaculated, “you never
strapped and all, Miss Betty, instead of lettin'
me see to it. And I'll be bound to say that
you've forgotten something.”
“No, Abigail dear, I think not. I have
with me all that I want.” But the old woman
was not yet quite satisfied, and would have
unstrapped the valise and gone through it all
afresh had not Betty diverted her attention by


126
asking her to brew for her a dish of tea before
she started on her journey. Abigail hurried
off to attend herself to such an unwonted order
as a dish of tea in the early morning. In 1717
tea was not a common luxury, and its prepara-
tion was not to be lightly entrusted to any one
of minor importance in the household. Then
for awhile Betty was idle, but the idleness did
not distress her at all. She seemed to take the
necessary waiting as a part of the work which
she had in hand and to be quite content to
exercise her patience. By and by Aunt
Priscilla joined her, and, as she had an infinity
of questions to ask and directions to give, the
time flew till breakfast.
It was still early when Robin, with his
mistress's valise strapped behind his saddle,
stood ready at the gate. He was not kept
long waiting, for very shortly Betty with a last
hug and kiss to her aunt and her old nurse,
was swung into her saddle, ready to depart.
Abigail hung round her to the last, adjusting
the folds of her habit, seeing that her foot was
well in the stirrup, and in every little act of
thoughtfulness manifesting her love.
At last she was off, and presently turning in
her saddle, as the road debouched at Swan
Walk, looked back with one last lingering look


127
at the old house where so much of her life had
been passed, and which had held for her so
much hope and joy. The last wrench is not
usually the least, and into those few moments
was gathered half a lifetime of pain. But this
too passed by; she was now in truth fully
embarked on her enterprise, whether for good
or ill.
In due time she reached Finsbury Square, and
filled Hester with surprise and consternation at
her unexpected movement. Miss Fenton was
old-fashioned to the last degree, and looked upon
such a journey as Betty contemplated as little
less than a tempting of Providence. She was,
however, delighted to see her, and, as usual,
made her welcome and tried forthwith to
persuade her to prolong her stay for at least a
few days. She was more surprised than ever,
when, after a short rest, Betty announced her
wish to go out into the town to make some
purchases, and on volunteering to come with
her. was gently told that the business she was
concerned in was of a very special nature, connected 
with a wish expressed long before by
her great-grandfather. Hester, as Betty had
reason to believe, knew nothing of the existence 
of the trust-money, and the latter
thought that such a real excuse for privacy


128
was better than any fictitious reason which she
could invent. So Betty went forth alone, and,
having made previous inquiries, found her way
at last to the banking house of Mr. Child.
She had been there before on various occasions
with the Alderman, but had always been driven
in a coach or carried in a chair, so that she did
not know the various streets and the turnings
necessary to take. It was a long walk from
Finsbury Square, and she was well tired with
both the exercise and the unaccustomed bustle
of the streets when she arrived at the house.
Having asked to see Mr. Child himself, she
was shown into a private room and sat down
to wait. The day was intensely hot and the
chair soft and enticing, and gradually, as she
leaned back, the hum of the city life which
floated in through the open windows died
away, her eyes closed and she sank into gentle
sleep. She suddenly wakened to find Mr.
Child standing in front of her, and with him
a grave clerk who was concealing behind his
extended hand the remains of a surreptitious
smile. She was filled with confusion, and her
pale face became aglow as she stammered out
an apology. The kindly banker, however, at
once set her at ease and asked if she were
really tired, and would she not rest awhile with



129
his daughters who had just returned from a
row upon the river. Betty thanked him gratefully 
but declined, and asked him to be so good
as not to make mention of the fact of her visit,
as she had come in all privacy to withdraw the
trust-money in accordance with the wish expressed 
to her by her great-grandfather. The
banker at once fell into her views, and having
obtained her formal signature, handed over to
her, in notes of the Bank of England, the sum
of a thousand guineas. He offered to have the
money sent for her where she would by a
trusty messenger, but as this would have at
once betrayed her plans she refused; whereupon 
Mr. Child said that he would have her
conveyed in his own chair to what place she
wished, so that she could regain the Alderman's
house, where she told him she was stopping,
without any unnecessary fatigue. And so, not
late in the afternoon, Betty, having been
set down in Finsbury Circus, re-entered the
house of the Alderman. Going straight to her
room she deposited in her valise the sum of
money which she had received, and then went
downstairs to sit with Hester. During her
absence the Alderman had been at home, and
hearing that she had gone out on a matter of
private business at once guessed that it was


130
connected with the trust-money. Without
taking Hester into his confidence he hastened
away to Temple Bar to try to find her. As he
went up Fleet Street she came down it, but
neither saw the other. In the evening when
he came home he tried to find out indirectly
from Betty if his suspicion was correct, but she
was on her guard and took care not to betray
herself; after a little friendly skirmishing
he gave up the contest, for the time, and
decided to await the development of circumstances.
Betty retired early, as she was to be ready
to start in the morning betimes. She bade
an affectionate good-night to both Hester and
the Alderman, and again thanked them very
tenderly for all their manifold kindnesses to
her. When securely locked and bolted in her
bedchamber, she opened her valise and took
from it the white dress which she had exchanged 
for the one placed there by Abigail,
and also the case with the golden buttons.
Then taking her housewife, she proceeded to
sew down the front of the dress the set of
buttons. She then packed in the valise the
dress which she had hitherto worn, and laid
out ready to wear in the morning the white
dress now so richly adorned, and also the


131
grey dust-wrap which was to cover it. Lastly,
she placed the case of the buttons back in the
valise, and taking from the same the old
dagger hid it in the pocket of the white
dress. This having been done she said her
prayers--long and earnest they were—and
betook herself to bed and to sleep.
At early morn she was awake, and rising,
dressed herself even to the dust-wrap.
Having completed her packing and strapped
her valise, she sat and waited patiently hour by
hour till some of the family should seek her.
In the city household the hours were fairly
early, and Hester was with her a little after
seven. She was once more astonished to see
her dressed and ready for the road, and
at first rallied her on her hurry, speaking as
though she was going to meet her betrothed,
and as though the time could not run fast
enough to satisfy her. Seeing, however, that
she did not blush or become in any way embarrassed,
she gave over this pleasantry and
asked many questions to make sure of the
perfection of all preparation. When she
examined the dust-wrap to see that Betty
was properly attired for travel, she expressed
her amazement at the way in which her cousin
had dressed herself for the journey.



132
“ Law, child !” she said, “you never surely
put on a white dress to ride through the dusty
roads; for what with the drought, they say
that out of London the roads be inches deep
in dust. And as to wearing your beautiful
buttons, it's simply a tempting of Providence,
and of highwaymen ; that it is! But there,
child, I know it's no use my scolding you,
for what your mind's set on that you will do,
though I argued and barged myself hoarse.
But do 'ee be careful and keep yourself well
covered, or folk will think you are going to
a bridal all unknown to your own kin.”
“Oh, Cousin Hester, surely to wear white is
not always to be going to be married !”
“No, child, surely not! It would be foolishness 
to say so. The dead wear white, so far
as that goes ; but then you don't put gold
buttons on grave-clothes—and such gold but-
tons too, and coming from where yours did.
Neither do you put on either white or buttons
to travel on a lonely road where there have
been enough robberies to make one fearsome.
Why, my dear, I'd no more put on my gold
ornaments for such a journey, and with no
more escort than old Robin carrying my valise
behind me, than I'd—than I'd dream of going
to St. Paul's to say my prayers alone. Well,


133
anyhow, if you will have things with you
that you oughtn't to have, you ought at least to see
that you have with you all that you should
have. Are your keys all right? and your
housewife? and your purse? and-
" “Oh yes, Hester ; I have everything quite
right,” interrupted Betty, for she was conscious
of that sharp dagger in her pocket as well as the
parcel of banknotes, and she feared lest Hester,
in her kindly zeal to ascertain that nothing had
been forgotten, should make the discovery of
either. When they went to breakfast they
found the Alderman waiting them. He was
full of concern for the journey, and wanted-
right or wrong—to send one or two of his
apprentices, armed, with Betty, for he said
he feared she might have some trouble by the
way. The Newmarket road had several times
of late been beset by footpads and highwaymen, 
and it was hardly safe or right for a
young lady to go out alone, or with only such
attendance as she had. Then Hester spoke of
the white dress and the golden buttons; and
the Alderman, then and there, announced his
intention of going on with her himself rather
than see her travel alone on such a journey.
So Betty, beginning to be afraid that some
real obstacle to the accomplishment of her


134
purpose might arise out of their solicitude
for her. laid herself out to overcome their
fears. She protested that there was no
danger ; that the journey was only a very
short one, a few miles at most, and through
roads that were much frequented; that she did
not fear any highwaymen ; and that, after all,
she was going to her own place, where she had
passed a large portion of her youth ; and that
it would seem strange and
and more than ungracious to the people who had always treated
her so well to appear to be afraid to come
amongst them alone or without escort; and she
knew that neither Hester nor her dear, kind
Alderman would like such a thing.
And so, though both the old folk knew that
the argument was bad, and were not a bit
satisfied as to either the safety or the propriety
of the journey, they gave in to her winning
gentleness and acquiesced in her going. They
comforted themselves with the thought that
after all, considering the number of people who
travelled, there were very few robberies, that
the very fact of Betty's journey being so
unusual would disarm their suspicions, and
that no man-even a highwayman—could
find it in 'him to rob so sweet and gentle a
child as Betty Pole.


135
As to Betty herself, it was a sore trouble to
her to mislead, even to so small an extent, the
friends who loved her and whom she loved
and trusted. It is one of the penalties of ill-doing, 
and perhaps not the least, that the
innocent that we fain would spare and hold
aloof from all evil, suffer and run danger of
deterioration, directly or indirectly, for our
faults. When the ship goes down, many an
atom that else had floated in good time safe
to land and survived the wreckage, is sucked
into the whirling maelstrom and disappears for
ever.
But no matter how prolonged partings may
be, the time comes at last; the forenoon had
still some time to run when Betty left the
house at Finsbury Square, and, turning back at
the corner, saw her friends still waving their
hands as they stood in the open doorway.


CHAPTER VII
NEAR MUCH HADAM
IN all her life before, Betty had never been
so gentle as she was on that journey ; and
old Robin, jogging along on his stout roadster,
watched her with affectionate eyes and marvelled. 
Her love and tenderness seemed to
go out to every living thing. For her the
summer pervaded all things, and there was in
her heart—in one of her hearts—a joyousness
that bubbled up perpetually. For she had two
hearts now. One which was full of pain and
weariness, for which life had all gone by and
which was but like the ash of an extinct fire,
with naught remaining but sentience and the
power to suffer pain. The other heart was
new and fresh—such a heart as might be in
the breast of one who had been born again in
a new and a higher life.
The roads were dusty, and the sun glared


137
fiercely as the noon drew nigh. The trees
and grass were losing the freshness of their
green; but there were places of deep shadow
where the trees arched over the roadway, and
there were many purling rills which made
music cool and sweet as the waters gurgled in
the chasms of their stony bed or flashed as
they fell.
In most of these calm, restful places
there was ever some life or other to interest the
traveller, and she lingered by them so long and
so often that Robin began seriously to think it
his duty to remonstrate with her on the delay,
and to call her attention to the length of the
journey still before them. When, however, he
saw her look at the cattle or the horses or the
very birds so lovingly, and heard her speak to
them so prettily--as though they had souls and
understandings of their own—he simply admired
her innocent sweetness and held his peace.
But as the afternoon drew on, and they had
still some way to go before reaching Bishop's
Stortford, he made up his mind to speak, and
stammeringly advised that they should get on
a little faster lest the night should close in
before they were at Much Hadam.
Betty thanked him sweetly, and said that she
would hurry if he wished it, but that it seemed
so nice to be in the real country, and the horses


138
enjoyed it so much more than hurrying on, that
she had not the heart to hasten. So Robin made
speed to tell his lady that his only dread was
that the journey might be so prolonged that
some mischance might happen. Then Betty
again thanked him for his thoughtfulness, and
quickened her pace somewhat, so that before
long they arrived at Bishop's Stortford, where
she put up for awhile at " The Rayne-deere "
and had dinner. As they had arrived some
time after the regular dinner-hour, it was necessary 
to wait till a fresh meal had been cooked ;
and then the eating of dinner took some little
time—for Betty, though not for Robin who got
through a very large dinner in a small space of
time.
Betty had much talk with the hostess, Mrs.
Unsworth, and with many of the servants; and
made much inquiry as to what had of late been
going on in the place. She even went into the
stables where the horses were being baited,
taking herself some crusts for them. Whilst there
she had talked with the grooms and postilions,
making inquiries as to the various parts of the
road between Bishop's Stortford and Ware, and
incidentally touching on the recent robberies.
The men were pleased with so much conversation 
from so great a lady and spoke freely, so


139
that ere she went on her way, Betty had some
clear idea of the general method in which the
robberies had of late been carried out on the
Cambridge road. All this made much delay,
so that when they had well started on their
way the afternoon was drawing to a close.
It was not very far to Betty's house at Much
Hadam, and so Robin was not anxious any
more, but was content to go as slowly as she
wished. One's faithfulness, however much it
be, has but little control over one's digestion,
and it is a wonderful thing what a different
complexion affairs assume after a good meal.
It would have been hard for a little while to
have fixed on any pace which would have been
too slow for old Robin.
But the slowest journey must progress somewhat, 
and at last they turned into the road
leading towards Ware, whence the by-road
to Betty's destination took its source. Here
Betty suddenly reined up and called Robin who
was jogging along a little way behind with his
chin sunk on his breast, and evidently more
than half asleep. He became fully awake to a
great mental confusion, and it took him some
few seconds to realise where he was and what
was before his mind.
" Lard-a-marcy, Miss Betty,” he finally said,


140
" but ye fairly frightened me! I thought that
summat had gone wrong wi' the saddle, or that
some of them—_” he paused, for under the
circumstance of absence from help, he did not
wish to speak disrespectfully of robbers—"some
of them-" Again he stopped.
“Of what ? ” said Betty, with a smile.
"Well, Miss, of some of them highway
gentlemen."
“Oh, Robin, what are you thinking of ? I
do believe you were asleep and dreaming.”
“Belike I was, Miss,” he added simply.
Well, Robin, I hope your dreams were
pleasant; or perhaps I ought not to hope that
or I should have to be sorry for interrupting
them, for I find that I left behind me at the
hotel my diamond ring with the cameo. It
was on the dressing-table where I washed for
dinner. You must ride back to Bishop's
Stortford as fast as you can and get it for me.
Mrs. Unsworth will give it to you, for I am
sure it will have been found by this time.”
“Lard-a-marcy!” said the old man, “what's
to become of you whilst I should go back?
You can't stay here on these roads alone, and
niver a soul nigh ye in case ye wanted help.”
But I don't want help, Robin. You will
not be long gone, and I shall ride slowly on


141
till you overtake me. Remember, I am close
to my own house and near my own people.”
But, Miss Betty dear, I daren't leave ye
all alone. Miss Priscilla told me on no account
to let ye out of my sight ; and as for Mrs.
Abigail, why she'd have my life if I were to
dare to do such a thing. That she would, and
more!”
“Don't fear, Robin,” said Betty smiling.
“In the first place Abigail will never know,
unless you tell her; and I am sure that even
Abigail would not say very pretty things to
you if I were to lose my beautiful ring because
you refused to obey my orders.” At this
Robin, manlike, gave in, so she went on-
“Now ride back, my good Robin, and get
my ring; and you may come after me as quickly
as ever you please. Stay ! take off my valise
and leave it here, so that you can go quicker.”
“What, Miss ! leave your trunk on the road-
side? Oh no! that would never do. 'Tis no
weight at all, and 'tis only a little way back.
Go slow, Miss Betty, and take care of yourself
till I come.” The old man, quite awake now,
rode back to Bishop's Stortford for the ring.
Betty rode slowly along at a foot's pace till
he was out of sight. Then she drew up a
moment in the shadow of a hazel grove and


142
dismounted. She took from her pocket the
sharp dagger and laid it bare in her breast
where she could grasp it in an instant; then
she unbuttoned her grey dust-wrap and threw
it back over her shoulders so that her white
dress with the golden buttons showed out. The
road here was shady and the ground underfoot
somewhat damp, so there was no rising dust
to mar the spotless fairness of her dress. She
drew close to a bank and climbed to her saddle
again, and then went on her way. The hoofs
of her horse made but little noise on the sand,
and the only sound she could hear, save the
myriad voices of nature, was the beating of her
own heart. For now the two hearts had
become one again. The new and joyous heart
had somehow ceased to carol, and the fire in
the heart of ashes had waked again. The two
hearts of this sorely anxious maiden, that spoke
of her past and her future, were merged in the
one great, human, beating heart which the
present needs.
As she went slowly along, every beauty of
the scene seemed revealed to her in a manner
which she had never felt before, and which it
seemed to her would henceforth become a part
of her memory and her life.
The road now ran through a valley, deep in


143
woods, in whose heart was a full stream with
waters which flowed in murmuring rills as the
valley fell, or widened into dark brown pools
which reached to the roadway and which took
their colours from the complementary shadows
of the green overhead. The undergrowth of
beech and hazel was thick and full of dark
shadows, dark in the shade which the great
oaks and elms already threw along the valley.
The sun was setting ; and as it sunk lower and
lower on the top of the slope that crowned the
valley, the shadows grew larger and larger.
And as the shadows grew, so the peace and
beauty of the scene won on Betty till her heart
ceased its tumult; and she could go on her way
with resolution unchecked, and without any
disturbance from within.
Before her there was a space where lay a
broad stream of light, for there was a dip in
the western slope of the valley, and the sunlight 
blazed, broad and red, across it. Here
the trees grew more lofty than elsewhere, and
on the eastern side of the road a dense mass
of foliage covered a low bank of grass which
rose some four feet above the road. As her
eyes lit on this, Betty shivered as though some
chill wind had blown upon her. She seemed
instinctively to realise that here was the place


144
she sought—the one spot which answered all
the conditions she expected. For an instant
she pressed her hand to her heart, and then
with a silent prayer passed on her way.
When pacing slowly along, with the hood
of her dust-wrap over her head and her face
turned to the glory of the sunset,' her horse
Suddenly stopped, so that she almost lost her
balance. There was a sudden shout from the
copse-
“Stop!” spoken by a ringing voice. On
the instant a black horse leaped down the
bank to the road, carrying a masked rider
who held a pistol at arm's length.
Then Betty knew that the moment of her
life had come. With a sudden spring she
threw herself from the saddle and caught the
rein of the black horse close to the bridle. As
she did this there was a cry from the rider, and
his hand fell to his side. Betty felt the horse
quiver, and knew that in a moment it would
try to dart away, and so cried out quickly—
“Unmask! unless you wish your horse to
trample me down !”
The answer came:" Let go the rein! For
God's sake, let go! I shall not harm you.”
“Unmask!” Her tone was of command, and
there was in her voice and bearing never a


145
trace or shadow of fear. The highwayman
seemed to recognise it, and, with a groan, drew
the velvet mask from his face.
" Rafe ! "
" Betty ! "
Her tone was full of sad conviction, the
simple conclusion of a train of thought: his
was of horrified despair. There was a long
pause, which Betty was the first to break.
“ Thank God, that it was I, and not
another, that came this road to-day!”
Then, seeing that Rafe was still silent, she
went on-
“Oh! Rafe, my heart told me all. I feared !
I feared! and I have come here all alone that
I might save you!"
Rafe leaped from his saddle.
“ Save me!"
“Ah yes, Rafe! to save you from this
horrible thing. Oh God! to think that you-
you of all men—should drop so low as to rob
on the highway!”
Rafe was still silent. Instinctively he had
taken his horse's rein through his arm, and the
beautiful animal stood patiently in sad contrast
-the one, the human animal, in spite of all the
high courage of his kind, feeling depraved and
degraded more than he had power to express ;



146
the other animal, full of its own pride, but
harrowed by no moral fear.
Betty's brain now began almost to reel. She
had so much to say-yet when the moment
came she could say nothing. She despised
herself for being so overcome—yet she would
not have been cold even at the price of the
power of coherency.
Little by little, however, the weight which
oppressed her seemed to leave her, and the
clouds about her brain to pass away. Then
all was clear before her, and in a very sweet,
grave way she began to tell her lover of her
fears for him : how justice was on his track
and how his career of crime was likely to be
atoned for in a very dreadful way-and here
she shuddered. But Rafe did not shudder ; on
the contrary, the idea of danger of any kind
was, in his present condition of overwhelming
shame, a restorative. There was something to
be fought for, something which he could oppose,
some action of the future or the present, rather
than the dull, impotent misery of regret; and
so the masculinity of him began to awake.
As she looked, Betty felt, rather than saw, the
change, and so her task became a harder one,
though she never faltered in the doing of it.
It was a more difficult thing to bring home the


147
sense of his guilt to the man of prouder bearing 
than to the man in the depths of despair,
seemingly ready to take any step to escape,
from his dreadful position.
There is, however, an adaptability in woman's
nature, intellectual as well as physical or
moral, which always answers when called upon.
Betty instinctively abandoned any idea which
she might have had of alluding to danger; but
she still pursued her object unfalteringly. As
Rafe's bearing was proud, she appealed to his
honour.
“Oh! Rafe, you told me that a gentleman
could not accept gifts ; and I would have given
you all I had! God knows what a delight and
pride it would have been for me to have had
the privilege of doing so. I dreaded, somehow,
lest want of any kind, or desperation, should
drive you to forget yourself. Would to God
that you had listened to me, or that I had had
the courage to speak !”
Here Rafe interrupted her impetuously-
Betty, surely you are at least without
blame. I have sinned, I know, but it has
nothing to do with you.”
Betty raised her eyes wonderingly to his.
Nothing to do with me, Rafe? and we
pledged to be married ! ”


148
A sudden joy shot through Rafe when he
heard the words “we pledged to be married,"
but it was quickly followed by a chill when the
sense of his present position flashed across
him. It was with a genuine, manly shame that
his eyes fell and his head sank upon his breast.
His voice was hoarse with an agony of his
own as he said-
“To be married, Betty? Alas! that must
be all past now. No, no! I am not such a
scoundrel as that!"
There was a pathos in his voice as he spoke
that had never been there before. He realised
his great loss. That was the penalty he had
to pay for his wrong-doing.
Betty's face was serene as she looked at him,
so straightly and so earnestly that, as if by some
mesmeric influence, he raised his eyes to meet
hers.
“We are promised to each other, Rafe,” she
said simply. “God heard our promise, and it
is not for us to go back from it, if He so wills
it in His good time."
Rafe sprang forward to catch her in his arms,
but the horse started a little, and the rein on
his arm held him off. There was a sort of grim
irony in the situation, which, however, both
Rafe and Betty were too agitated to notice.


149
It was, perhaps, only a natural manifestation
of masculine nature, but when the conviction
began to dawn upon him that he had not lost
Betty's love, the supremacy of the man over
the woman began unconsciously to assert itself.
“You had better get on your way, Betty,”
he said, in an authoritative manner; "the
roads are not safe, and it was unwise to come
alone.”
The speech may seem inconsequent, but both
speaker and hearer understood the connection.
The silences of lovers, and the habits of such
silent understandings, are known to themselves.
Then a thought seemed to strike him, and he
added, with a horrified expression on his face--
" My God! if it had been some other than
me !"
Betty said sadly : “Would to God, Rafe,
that it had!"
“But you don't know the danger!”
Here a momentary pang of bitterness swept
over Betty's heart, and she answered out of the
quickness of her woman's speech-
Aye, Rafe ; you know better than I do the
highwayman's mercy!”
Then followed quickly the reaction of her
long restraint, and in a burst of passion she
poured forth her whole heart, and all that had


150
been torturing her during the past two days.
She ended thus-
But, Rafe, it was because I feared it, and
dreaded it, that I came. If it were bad for me,
an innocent woman, to suffer, what must the
guilt be that makes such a fear to you. Oh,
Rafe! Rafe! what mattered the danger to me,
a dead woman-aye, a dead woman !" for she
saw the question in his face. " What life is in
one when the hopes are shattered, and the fire
in the heart is quenched ? I would have given
my life for you, Rafe, as you did for me.
Why, then, should I hesitate to run a danger
for your sake?'
Here Rafe interrupted-
But, my God! Betty, you don't know the
danger. These men are the roughest, the
cruellest, the most remorseless wretches that
exist!'
He ground his teeth with passion at the
horrible possibilities that rose before his mind.
Betty looked at him a moment, and her heart
began to beat with a new hope. The lesson of
his own shame and ill-doing, and what it meant
to her eyes, was coming home to him ; out of
his very passion might come his reclamation.
He would, she reasoned to herself, never have
experienced such emotion if he were truly


151
hardened; and so she felt she could enter on a
new phase of her task. Still calmly looking
him in the face, she put her hand in the bosom
of her dress and pulled out her sharp dagger.
See!” she said, as she held it out towards
him, “ I did not come unarmed !”
Rafe smiled a bitter smile, wrung from the
depths of his masculine experience.
“A good weapon, child, but of small use
against a desperate man. He would have
beaten it from your hand with his whip or
his pistol-butt before you could have struck
a blow."
Betty answered calmly, as she replaced the
dagger in her breast-
It was not for him !”
Who for, then? Good God! Betty, not for
yourself? ” he added, as the thought struck him.
“ For myself, Rafe! I did not come out on
this desperate enterprise without weighing well
the consequences. But I saw my duty clear
before me, and I had no alternative. Oh,
Rafe! Rafe! it was a desperate choice.” Here
she broke down for a moment, but recovered
herself and went on, without even a falter in
her voice-
· In any case I must have suffered such a
loss—my life or my love, my life or my love!”


152
They were both silent, and then a new
thought struck Rafe, and he asked-
" But how did you know you would meet
me? The chances were a thousand to one
against such a thing !”
“ Oh! Rafe, my heart told me. ”
" Your heart told you !” said Rafe, with
sudden bitterness. “ Your heart told you that
I was a robber, when you had no grounds even
to imagine such a thing. And yet you come
here with those gold buttons on your dress.
Love without faith' indeed ! And so this
was your faith in me! that unheard you condemned 
me and held me as guilty.”
He became fairly speechless with indignation.
Betty was so overwhelmed with this monstrous
change of front—this outcome of jealousy and
love and vanity, which was so thoroughly
masculine in its nature as to be beyond feminine
comprehension. She stood silent and hung
her head, for the rebuke touched her deeply
in her inner nature; she felt the remorse
that she might, and would, have felt had her
supposition as to Rafe's misdoing proved
untrue. Betty was a girl who seldom cried,
and more especially when the tears came from
any emotion beginning with herself. Now and
again she wept at hearing or reading a piteous


153
tale or seeing such told in a play, but her tears
came gently and passed soon ; but when she
wept with cause her tears were very tears of
blood. At such times, even before the tears.
fell, dark circles grew round her beautiful eyes,
and the misery of her soul became very pitiful
To see. Rafe saw the tears fall from her downcast 
eyes, but his anger was hot-jealousy is so
hard to efface—and even Betty's tears did not
move him at once. Then the anguish of the
poor girl's heart found a voice ; in a deep, low
tone which smote on his ears with a pang which
he never forgot she said-
“ Oh, Rafe! Rafe! my lost love! Would to
God that my fears had been untrue! My life
would have been well spent to have learned so
sweet a truth! ”
Then, in an instant, down at her feet fell
Rafe, all the man in him rising to the height of
his humility. Down into the dust, on his knees,
with his face in his hands. The rein slipping
from his arm freed the horse which started
away, but stopped at once and began quietly
to browse the herbage on the bank.
Betty still wept, but her tears were such as
angels shed ; and all the sorrow of her heart
was turned to instant joy. Rafe was won !
His heart was true, and she felt that there had


154
come the dawn of a new life. At that moment,
as though it were some mysterious presage, the
day fell. The sun sank over the hill, and the
red light fading left the girl, who stood with her
hand on her lover's head, pale and spirit-like.
Her dress of white gleamed out beneath the
thrown-back mantle of grey, and the golden
buttons twinkled like stars in the night.
So they stood for a moment ; but Betty
suddenly raised her head and listened, and
both the horses raised their ears and listened
too. Far away came the quick stroke of a
horse's feet on the high-road ; Robin was
evidently coming at a gallop a way that was
new to him. Betty said quietly-
“ Robin is returning ; he must not find you
here. No living soul but you and I know this
sad secret ; and, Rafe dear, it must die with us.
You must go away for a time; it will be best
for you, as for us all. Go abroad to the wars,
where you can begin life afresh. Think that
you go to win back your honour, and so to claim
the hand of the wife that waits for you. See
here! I have brought with me money that
will keep you from want, and help you in
your career,” and she produced the packet
that Mr. Child had given her. “Take it,
Rafe!”


155
But Rafe sunk his head lower and lower, and
spoke without looking up-
“Oh! spare me—spare me this!”
“ Nay,” she said, " Rafe dear, there is
nothing to spare. This is not mine to give. I
knew you would not receive from me—would
to God that your pride had not been so ; but
that is past. This is a trust which my dear
grandfather left me. He gave it to me the
very night he died; and it is as though he were
come from the grave to give it you. Take it,
Rafe! It is a holy trust ; and hereafter, if you
may be able to do so, you may yet pass it on to
others, so that it can help some in dire straits.
Surely, Rafe,” she added, as he still hesitated
—“surely I have won to-day the right to ask
you that no such trouble should come upon you
again, when with this trust-money we can avert
it. Your own heart must tell you that I am right.
Quick ! quick!” for the gallop sounded nearer.
Rafe put up his hand and took the packet;
then he seized her hand and held it a moment
to his lips, and looked up in her eyes as he said
solemnly-
" Betty, as God sees us, this hand shall never
sin in such way again. It shall never be less
worthy than now when it touches the hand of
one of His saints."


156
“Oh! hush, hush, Rafe!” said Betty, overwhelmed 
with emotion.
Rafe sprang to his feet; the manhood
of him seemed triumphant again, and all the
nobler part of the soul within stood revealed
without dross.
“ Betty, if I am spared I shall come back to
claim you ; and if I do so come, I shall feel
worthy to ask you to share my life. But living
or dying I shall send you word, if I do not
bring it, that your faith has been justified.
Goodbye! Goodbye!” Betty held out her
arms, and he sprang to them, and for an instant
enfolded her in a passionate embrace. Then
he tore himself away. He paused a second
and returned.
“Give me a keepsake,” he said. " Something 
that I can wear over my heart, and which
will be with me always as the symbol of your
faith and love.”
“ Take one of the buttons, Rafe ; they are
dear to us both,” she said shyly. He stooped
and caught one in his hand—the one nearest
the ground.
“Why that one, Rafe?
Because it is fittest for me. 'Tis nearest to
your garment's hem."
“No, no, Rafe! take this !” Pulling out the


157
dagger, she severed the third of the buttons,
held it an instant to her lips, and handed it to
him.
" 'Tis nearest to my heart.”
Rafe's breast heaved; he looked at her one
moment, flung himself to the dust, and kissed
the hem of her dress ; then, without a word,
sprang to his saddle, and with a wave of his
hand, leaped up the bank whence he had come.
Betty heard the crash of his passage through
the short undergrowth as he started, as the
crow flies, towards Harwich, to take that night
a fishing-boat to Holland.
As she watched him go, even in the anguish
of her parting, Betty gloried in the strength
and daring of her lover, in his rapid action, and
the vigour of his determination; and, woman-
like, she felt happy because the man was strong.
Then she drew her horse to the bank,
climbed into the saddle, and pushed hastily on
Her way. She did not look back as the coming
horseman drew closer, but only turned when
she found that the speed did not diminish on
his approach. For an instant she was startled
as a woman, magnificently mounted, swept by
at break-neck speed ; but before horse and rider
had dissolved into the shadows of the evening,



158
she recognised beneath the woman's habit the
free carriage of a man. A new gush of thankfulness 
went up from her heart, for she knew it
was the rider with the money of the New
River Company. Her heart beat fast at the
thought of how close had been the rescue of
Rafe, and a new thankfulness filled her soul.
However, she proceeded on her way thankfully, 
so that when presently Robin, riding hot
haste, overtook her, she was some distance
from the scene of the meeting.
Dear heart, Miss Betty!" said the honest
fellow as he rode up, “but I feared ye would
be lost when the night fell. I have the ring ;
but we must push on, or 'twill be dark before
we reach the house. And oh! Miss, when that
daredevil woman rode past me like a flash I
couldn't but think that mayhap some of those
highway gentlemen's ladies had took to the road
too! I feared till I saw you safe ahead o' me.”
That night when Robin, after his supper,
was relating to the servants in the kitchen all
the adventures of the day he added-
“ And sure I am that the change has done
Miss Betty-Lord love her !--good already.
She hasn't been so gay for days and days as
when I came up to her in the road. She was
singing to herself like a bird, and her eyes were
like stars."


CHAPTER VIII
IN FINSBURY SQUARE
AS the next five years flew by they saw
many changes in many things, but none
in the heart of Betty Pole. The new dynasty
grew more and more a part of the life and the
future of England, and the thunder, which
followed ever the hopes of the Stuarts, was but
as the far roll of elemental disturbance which
makes apparent to all men their own immediate 
safety. Everything was prosperous with
Betty in the way of fortune, and her wealth
grew with each year, despite the fact that the
many calls on her charity were never unanswered, 
and that the other members of the
family looked to her - and did not look in
vain-for countenance in all their aspirations
and endeavours. One great loss there was in
the household, and only one : Priscilla slept at
peace.


160
From the evening when they had parted on
the road to Much Hadam, Betty had never
heard from Rafe or of him. He had disappeared 
as effectually as if the earth had
swallowed him. Betty's faith never faltered.
She believed that one day he would appear, or
that some message from him would reach her,
and in that belief she rested serenely. Some
time after his disappearance she had taken into
her own hands certain large sums of money,
much to the chagrin of the vigilant Alderman,
who remonstrated with her for withdrawing
from active use any money at a time when with
decent care it would multiply itself through the
rage for public speculation. Betty did not
attempt to argue on the subject with him, but
told him that it was in the fulfilment of a duty,
and begged him not to make a somewhat
difficult task into a labour of pain. She spoke
to him so sweetly, and withal so warmly, of her
gratitude to him for his constant care, that the
old gentleman, although somewhat chagrined
and jealous as to the cause of her mystery,
abandoned the subject except at rare intervals.
Then after a time strange rumours began to
be heard. The agents of Lord Baltimore received 
a mysterious letter saying that if they
searched in a certain place in Wandsworth they


161
would find the money stolen so long before.
They sought the place with a select following
of servants, and sure enough found an amount
in new gold larger than the sum stolen. This
strange occurrence was followed at irregular
intervals by similar ones, till after a time it was
found that quite a number of persons who had
been robbed near London in the early half of
1717 had had full restitution made to them.
The matter was the subject of comment in the
coffee-houses, and many were the surmises as
to the cause or means of so unusual a set of
circumstances.
All this time Betty lived partly at her house
at Much Hadam and partly at Chelsea. She
had now many affairs to keep her busy, and she
often made calls at the counting-house of Mr.
Child and lodged and drew much money from
time to time. She went much amongst poor and
distressed persons. Sometimes her ministrations 
of this kind took her to places beyond the
Liberties of the city ; but she smiled at warnings 
against footpads and went on her way.
Now and again she paid visits to the prisons ;
and although she always went with a sort of
dread upon her, and her, and suffered much whilst
witnessing the pain and degradation of the
poor souls held in durance, she came away as


162
if cheered and benefited by the accomplishment
of her good work.
Once, after the news had been told in the
coffee-houses of another mysterious finding of
stolen property, the old Alderman came out to
pay her a visit. For a time he had been angry
and indignant at the disappearance of her
affianced husband, and, manlike, had managed,
whilst trying to comfort the poor girl, to visit
on her head some of his disapprobation. She
had borne it all meekly, and had held herself
with such a grave manner that her friends had
hardly ventured to condole with her on her loss
or misfortune—they did not know which to
consider Rafe's disappearance.
On this occasion the Alderman did not come
in his great carriage with rich hammercloth
and with coachman and big servants in gorgeous 
livery, which he had continued to use
on great occasions since he had been Lord
Mayor, but in a plain coach with no servant
but the driver. Betty was all alone; she was
delighted to see her old friend, and made him
very welcome. He, however, was manifestly
ill at ease and had something on his mind; so
when they sat together in the cool drawing-room 
Betty laid her little hand on the back of
his great one and said-


163
" What is it? I know something is troubling
you. Won't you tell me? ”
The Alderman seemed relieved to have the
matter commenced, though for the moment his
embarrassment increased and he grew red and
stammered.
My dear, I'll do anything in all the wide
world that you wish,” he said ; and then added
hastily and inconsequently-
Betty, do you want any money? I mean
any large sums."
Betty was really surprised, and with wide-open 
eyes she answered—
“No, Cousin Fenton. I have more than I
shall ever want."
“But I mean, my dear, money to deal with
--money-—" he stammered and stuttered for
a second or two and then spoke with grave,
frank directness-
“I mean, Betty, my dear, more money,
such as you have drawn from us and spent
in your own way.” Betty shook her head ;
he went on, and there was a tremor in his
voice-
“I mean money to deal with as you dealt
with that thousand guineas of your grandfather's. 
Oh, my dear! my dear! I have been
thinking; and somehow I seem to know now.


164
I take back all I said of money to you, Betty
dear! You were right and I was wrong; and
now I want you to understand that if you want
any more money to do what you will with-
even to throw it away-I shall be only too
proud if you will let me give it to you. For
all I have is, in the end, for you, Betty! And
oh! my dear; you were right. You are right
in all you do; and how I honour you! All last
night I lay awake, thinking of you ; and I
seemed to see you setting out that day from
my door in your pretty white frock and your
gold buttons. I didn't know what it all meant,
and in my blind obstinacy I must have caused
you grievous pain--and more, piled up your
troubles and difficulties on you. I'll never get
the sight of you on that morning out of my
eyes again. And I never want to, my dear,
for the good Lord was with you on your
journey that day; and if I had only known-
Here the old man fairly burst out crying,
and taking Betty's two hands in his raised
them to his lips and kissed them and went on,
whilst Betty drawing from her bosom a gold
button by its white silk string, kissed it-
“My dear child, when I see you bearing
your trouble so bravely, and striving so to do
all that is right, I think better of others—of all


165
others—for your sweet sake; and I pray that
you may yet have the desire of your heart of
hearts. I hope and pray God with all my soul
that in time to come your life will be blessed
with love—that love you hope for : the love of
a good and worthy husband, whom you can
honour and who will love and honour you as
you should be loved and honoured!”
Then Betty bent over his great, wrinkled
hands and kissed them and raised her eyes to
his. He saw the dark marks come round
them ; and then she too burst out crying.
And so without further words these two great
hearts understood all, and they found much
comfort in the silent sympathy.
They never spoke of the matter again,
either of money or of Rafe, but from that day
the old merchant had many inquiries made
secretly, and kept watch for any sign of the
missing man.
No one ever mentioned Rafe to Betty, or
directly or indirectly alluded to marriage.
Would-be suitors there were many, for the
greatness of her fortune was known; but, living
retired equally at Much Hadam or Chelsea,
Miss Pole gave no opportunity of wooing.
Now and again there came from the wars,
which, here and there, ever convulsed some


166
part of Europe, rumours of some gallant deed
wrought by some unknown soldier; and Betty's
hopes grew high. The age was one when
soldiers of fortune were not uncommon; and
when the tales of the camp-fire had found their
way to the hearth and men's blood quickened
and women's tears fell fast at the recounting
of some heroic deed, Betty's heart would beat
at the thought : " That might be my Rafe!
'Twere surely like him ;” and there would rise
before her inner eye the image of that gallant
horseman whom for her Time had purified
from his base surroundings. But alas! these
gallant heroes either fought their way to fame
and the knowledge of the world, or else they
perished and were heard of no more ; and
Betty's hopes grew colder and colder still,
though her faith was as warm as ever.
One day-it was the fifth anniversary of the
day she had made the journey to Much Hadam-
Betty went into the city to pay a visit to her
Cousin Fenton. It was not altogether that she
wished to see her friends, but she had a hungry
longing to go over once again at least a part of
that journey which had such dire and sweet
results. In the hot afternoon she left Mr.
Child's bank, and sending her carriage to the
stables of the “Saracen's Head," walked all


167
the way to Finsbury Square. She intended to
surprise her cousin, and so took her way into
the garden by the wicket at the back.
The garden was fresh and delicious, for the
Alderman loved flowers, and his were well kept
and constantly watered. Even on this burning
afternoon they all looked sweet and bright; the
turf plot was green as emerald with long grass
studded with sweet summer flowers, and from
the tiny beds rose beautiful turncap lilies and
great, heavy-hearted roses, bending from the
stakes round which they were twined. Here
she wandered for a while, and then climbing the
steps, without seeing any of the maids, entered
the Alderman's cosy room which looked out on
the garden. The room was darkened by the
summer blinds; and the heavy Turkey curtains
which shut the room off from the great dining-room 
beyond were drawn. The windows were
open, and into the room stole the sweetness of
the flowers and the muffled roar of the city
without. Betty sat down in a great leather-covered 
chair, half as big as a sofa, and made
up her mind to wait and rest until her cousin
should appear. The hum of the bees in the
garden and the roar of the city merged in one-
and Betty fell asleep.
She was partially awakened by the opening


168
of a door in the room beyond and the Alderman's 
heavy footfall. She was just making up
her mind to become fully awake and speak to
him when there was a knocking at the outer
door. Presently the door was opened again
and the voice of a maid said-
“It is a gentleman to see you, sir.”
“What name did he give ?”
“ He asked to be excused giving his name,
sir. He said he was wishful to see you alone
if he might ; that he had waited till he had
seen you enter, and that you would know him
if you saw him."
What was it that brought up Betty sitting in
the great armchair with extended hands tightly
grasping the arms and her eyes glowing ? She
was all awake now, and though at the first her
impulse had been to depart on hearing the
stranger's message, she did not now think of
moving. She heard the old Alderman say-
Wishful to see me alone-would know him
if I see him ; strange! Show him in, Hannah !
and if your mistress comes whilst he is here
simply tell her that I am engaged.”
The seconds that passed were agony to
Betty. She thought-she did not know what;
she hoped—she did not know what. She
caught sight of herself in a great mirror and


169
saw the white frock, which she always wore on
this day of the year, and noted the gaps left
where two of the gold buttons were gone.
The door opened, closed again, and there
was a pause. Betty sat like one in a dream
and waited, her heart standing still in expectancy. 
Then came a voice which went through
Betty's heart like sunshine, or a note of celestial
music. She wondered how any one in the wide
world who had ever heard it could fail to know
it again. She would have liked to cry out—to
sing—to spring to her feet and rush through
the curtains and throw herself into the loving
arms that she knew would be stretched out to
her. But, as people usually are in moments of
supreme emotion, she was self-contained and
sat silent, though in an ecstasy. She did not
go away now; she did not mean to go. She
would wait, for wherever Rafe's voice was, she
had a right to be there. She had won that
right out of her love and patience and belief;
and there was none in all the wide world, she
was sure, who would wish her to go. Rafe
had simply said —
“ Mr. Fenton, I would like a word with you
if I may be so privileged.”
The Alderman's tone as he answered was noncommittal ; 
Betty knew by it that he had not


170
recognised his. visitor, and a wild thrill shot
through her as to how Rafe could have become
so changed that Cousin Fenton did not know
him.
“ I shall be pleased, sir. Pray be seated.”
When Rafe spoke there was a sweet humility
in the tone of the answer which brought a
quick thought to Betty that the years had not
passed in vain-
“I thank you, sir, for your courtesy; but
there are reasons why I may not be seated in
this house, or in your presence, until you are
aware of who I am.
“Of who you are! Sir, the room is dark
and my eyes are not young!”
There was the sound of a drawn curtain, and
then an exclamation-
“ Rafe! Mr. Otwell! Sir, this is strange
indeed. You have not hurried in your coming!”
Betty could not but be glad that he had pronounced 
the Christian name first, as though
the young man had been in his thoughts ; but
it made her wince to hear the later words.
Rafe's answer went straight to her heart.
“Ah, sir, you are justified in any words you
may use to me. But I fain would ask you
not to judge me altogether too hardly for that
fault. See here!”


171
The Alderman's answer explained his reason,
as it came in horrified tones-
“The marks on your wrists! Are they of
chains ?”
" Yes. ”
There was a pause, then came the Alderman's 
remark in a constrained voice-
“When a man comes from prison, there is
need to explain- "
“ You need not fear, sir. God knows that
I have much to answer for ; but though I well
merited chains and prison, it was not my demerits 
that set these marks upon my wrists.”
Betty listened with a sickening heart, and her
one idea was to kiss those maimed wrists; but
her eyes flashed as he went on : " They were
won for me in battle against the Turks, for
Faith and Freedom. For a whole year I wrought
in a Turkish galley. But this is not to the
point; I deserved to suffer, and I do not dare
to repine. I only mention this old pain because
I would fain beg a little forbearance, if not a
little sympathy. Oh sir, yours is the first face
that I have seen of all that I knew in the life
here that seems so long ago. Yours is the
first of the old voices that I have heard ; and it
may be the last, for I have come unknown to
any, and I may depart the same. I know how


172
little I deserve from any man, and least of all
from you, to whom of old I showed so little
courtesy, not knowing then your worth, or
perhaps being jealous of it. But there is a
hunger in my very soul. I would not forget
my manhood—But !It is in such moments
that we remember it."
Betty longed to fly to him to comfort him,
but she waited she knew not how. She had
her reward, for they were tears of joy which
burst from her eyes as her old cousin said, with
a sob in his voice-
" Nay, sir; God forbid that I should be harsh
with one who has suffered. There is my hand
if you will, and glad I shall be if I can do good
to you—for another's sake if not for your
own. "
The clasp of the men's hands appeared to
draw them together, for the voices of both
seemed more at ease as they went on. Rafe
was the first to speak-
“I have much to say, but a certain duty
comes the first.
Sir, do you know my sad
story—or must I tell all my shame afresh ?”
Go on, sir! Go on! I think I know
enough to understand.”
"I have been so long away, and have had
no means of knowing aught that has happened.


173
The long suspense has been a part of my
punishment. I have made some gain in the
wars, and I have to make some restitution. No
man can undo altogether such wrongs as mine,
but he can search out and restore."
Here the Alderman interrupted-
That has been done long ago–I daresay
you can guess by whom.”
In the silence that followed Betty seemed in
her inner eye to see the grave bowing of
that erect head. Then Raſe went on, though
from the broken voice Betty could tell how
much his heart had been troubled-
Beyond this I wish to place ten times the
sum in good hands for the use and benefit of
others. I thought that you would accept the
trust—for charity's sake, not for mine. I feel
it ill to ask even such a thing from you whose
hands have always wrought in honour ; but
with so upright a career as yours you can well
afford to minister a charity, though the hands
are not clean which entrust it to you.'
“I accept it, sir,” said the old man, “and
with a joy unspeakable.”
“And now, sir,” said Rafe, with a choking
in his voice, "you may perhaps answer me two
questions. Is Betty-is Miss Pole alive?"
“She is ! Thank Almighty God, she is !”


174
“God be thanked ! And-and-is she
married; or has she kept single?”
“She is single still.”
Again there was a long pause, and Betty,
looking out straight in front of her, saw her
image in the tall mirror. She dared not stir ;
she might not venture even to put a sheltering
hand before her burning face lest the rustle
of her dress should betray her presence. It
seemed to her that, listening as she was in
secret, it was almost immodest to behold even
her own image in the glass, and so closed her
eyes-and listened. She heard Rafe sob, and
each word went beating through her heart like
the throb of a giant pulse. With ears strained
to every sound she heard the Alderman step
close to him and the sound of his laying his
hand on his shoulder. And then came his
voice full of kindliness-
Nay, lad, don't cry. Heart, man! There
is hope for us all."
“ Thank God for hope ! Oh, sir, in the
years that have gone by I have found hope
such a bitter pleasure that not seldom have I
realised what the men of old meant when they
said it was the last evil in Pandora's box.
Many a starlit night, when I lay out on the
plains or up the mountain slopes, have I thought


175
and thought that a time might come when I
should set foot on this dear English soil again,
and that life might begin afresh for me here.
But with the hope came dread thoughts that
all might come too late. But still God be
thanked for hope, for without it many a poor
soul-and mine among them—would long ago
have succumbed. And now, dear sir, I have
one more thing to ask. I ask it as a favour
from one man to another, in no wise to take
after-responsibility, but only to advise me out
of your greater knowledge.”
There was a conscious stiffening of the old
man's manner, and a hardening of his voice as
he replied-
“Go on, young sir. Let me hear what it is
that you wish ; then I shall be better able
to judge how far I may further
your desires.”
Again a long pause; and then Rafe spoke,
but this time his voice had a new charm for
Betty. It was the old voice, strong and full
and mellow; but oh, how refined ! Even amid
her joy at such a change, Betty's heart was
wrung with the thought that so much pain to
him must have gone to the refining-
“I come back as poor as I went, for all that
I have won is but to restore that which belonged
to others, and to make some reparation through


176
the poor. There is one other sum, a thousand
guineas, which has been a trust, and which has
done no unworthy work whilst I have been its
guardian. Of this I can speak freely and
frankly, for it is not from myself but from that
sweet saint who sent me out to try to purge my
sin and to win honour again. It has freed
captives and saved men's bodies, and I humbly
trust their souls too. Beyond these monies I
have nothing but my personal belongings, and
I come to my own land as naked as a babe, to
try to win something of the place I lost. Now
I want you to tell me something according to
your best judgment. I have come to you of
all men because I know you to be unflinchingly
upright in all ways, and because I know that
you are, first of all, a firm and true friend of
Betty Pole; that you will not let anything in
the wide world come between her and what is
most for her good. I know well, sir-as well
as any man can know anything—that it would
not be for the best, were all things starting
from to-day, that such a pure, sweet, noble
young thing as Betty should mate with such a
stained and sinful man as I am. But I cannot
shut out from my reasoning any more than I
can from my memory, all the sweet moments
when she was pledged to me. She herself


177
might not wish all the past obliterated ; and
hers is the right to choose if she so wills it-
most certainly in so far as I am concerned.
How, then, should I act so as to deny her no
happiness, or to cause her the least pain? To
me she is a living truth, and I cannot take from
her acts or her words one little thing and
believe that in that she was untruthful when all
else was so crystal bright. I believe, as I live,
that I am man enough to go away and make
no sign, so that she may deem me dead, and so
leave her life more free. Nay more, I can go
away and have set on foot a rumour of my
death, so that she may not be tortured with
any hope. You are her friend, her wise and
constant friend ; and I shall be deeply grateful
if you will aid me with your counsel on her
behalf.” He paused, and the rapture of Betty's
face was a joy to the angels.
The Alderman blew his nose violently, and
said in a choky voice-
Young sir, your words are brave ; and on
my soul and honour I believe them. But they
should be spoken in a young maid's ear-
nay, in the very ear of our young maid herself - 
rather than to an old loveless and childless
man, as I am.”
Then Betty stood up. Her heart had beat


178
heavily all through Rafe's saying, and, though
in her secret heart her mind was made up as to
what she should do, she wanted the endorsement 
of others as to its wisdom in order to
complete her happiness. She was only a
young maid, after all, and the care of choosing
between good and bad is not rightly for young
heads and hearts that are not steeled to the
ways of the world. But she waited, covering
her eyes with her hot hands, and listened
a little longer. Rafe's voice came now more
eagerly, the hope in his heart was growing ;
his long penance had done its work in purging
his soul, and he spoke now more like a free
man-more like the old Rafe-
“Nay, but, sir, will you not help me?—not for
my sake, but for Betty's. It is of her that I
think, and it is for her that I would act. Will
you give me a hint as to what is for her good,
or rather for her happiness ?”
The old man was evidently troubled in his
mind, for he paused. Betty waited in an
agony of expectation. But when the Alderman 
spoke her heart leaped, for he answered in
tones that she had seldom heard from him-
“God forbid that I, or such a poor opinion
as mine, should stand in the way when the
Lord has been doing His own work and leading


179
back a lost sheep to the fold. But oh! sir,
search your own heart. Think of what a
terrible responsibility you take upon yourself if
you win the right to guard the happiness of
that young life. Think what it would be—what
it must be—if you were to take even the
smallest step backward from the way that you
have won. Think of the harrowing anxiety
that for many a long year would be in her
heart regarding your every step, no matter
how well intentioned or well ordered it might
be.
“Ah! sir, I see you are moved. That is
good. Then let me tell you more—more than
I ever dreamed of telling you till now. In my
heart I feel—nay, I know—that our dear Betty
loves you still. That for all these years she
has been watching the hands of the clock as
they crawled round the dial. That her thoughts
have been of you and for you. And then think
how every act or word of yours, if not of the
highest, would shatter that high ideal in her
mind—nay, would even reveal to her that
you are only a man like the rest of us, with a
man's failings, and compact of clay. It would
break that tender, loving, patient heart. This
is a battle, sir, that a man must fight out alone.
Judge for yourself, sir, and may the good God


180
aid you in the task of judging wisely! Ah!
that is right. You can never be wrong, sir,
whilst you take counsel like that. Would that
Betty might be here to see you on your knees
in such a cause!”
Betty, with her eyes still shut, put out her
arms instinctively as though to embrace—she
did not know which, her lover or the old
friend who so comforted him in his trouble.
Then Rafe spoke again-
“I shall take your kindly warning, sir, and
spend the night in thought. I have looked at
the matter hitherto perhaps selfishly and in too
great self-belief. To-morrow, if I see that my
duty is to go without seeing Betty, I shall send
you word; and, if this be the sad result of my
thought, then I charge you on your faith and
honour that never by word or deed shall you
even hint of this day, for its end may be that
I shall simply pass away. If I think I am
justified in staying, that I have learned
sufficiently to trust myself, then I shall go to
Chelsea. Whatever be the result, let me say
that to the last hour of my life I shall be
grateful to you for your attitude to me to-day -you
from whom I deserve so little, and on
whose loved one I have brought such trouble
and such pain.”


181
Stay, sir! you must not go without some
assurance that I shall see you again. You
may miscalculate your own strength in this
matter, and be driven to some desperate act.”
“No, sir ; be not alarmed on that score. I
have, since we met last, been through too
many bitter experiences to do aught rashly.
And if it be that you fear that some time I
may foredo my own life, again I say, be not
alarmed. It is true that I do not fear death.
In the years that have gone, I have seen too
many souls take Alight; I have looked too
often into the eyes of Death to fear them.
I have come to regard dying only as a means
to an end ; and with that new insight that end
is too holy to be tampered with by any fell act
of mine. But if it will give you ease, I promise
that I shall not leave England without coming
to see you again, without taking hope from
your kindness, without bearing comfort and
fortitude from the grasp of your honest hand.'
“ Then when may I expect you, if, indeed,
we are to lose you?—and I pray that such
may not be.”
“At this hour the day after to-morrow. If
I feel that I may see Betty and learn her
wishes from her own true lips, I shall go to
Chelsea in the afternoon of to-morrow, If not,


182
or, if, as it may be, Betty will not or cannot
let all things be as they were before I shut the
gates of that Paradise on myself, then I shall
see you, as I said, at this hour of the day following; 
and shall then beg you of your goodness
to be my almoner for that sum for charity of
which I spoke."
Betty here could stand no more. She felt,
now that the torturing fears of her heart were
stilled, that she had no right to be an unknown
confidant of such secrets. It came upon her
with a rush that she had been an eavesdropper,
though sure it was that the angels themselves
could not have blamed one in her plight. She
wished to be away-away anywhere—where
she could hide her joy and, in its vastness, this
little shame; where she could sink, unchallenged, 
to her knees and unburden her glad
soul to God. In the midst of all the thought
was one fixed and dominant idea that she must
not interfere with Rafe's project. This was the
struggle, the final struggle and test of his own
soul; and it must be wrought out alone. Well
she knew that if he failed to know her glad and
perfect happiness to take all risks with him, she
would herself come to him and tell him to be of
good cheer. She knew now where to find him,
if there should be need. The doubt was a very


183
small one, for she seemed to know that the
morrow afternoon would see him at Cheyne
Walk.
And so she stole away out of the room, trembling 
lest a rustle of her dress should betray
her. Down the steps she went, and out into
the garden. The shrubs hid her from the
house, and, not stopping to notice the new
beauty which had come upon the flowers, she
stole, feeling like a guilty thing, through the
garden and out noiselessly through the wicket
into the quiet lane-way behind the house.
Before long she was at the “ Saracen's Head,”
and having ordered her carriage with all speed,
was on her way to Chelsea before the sun
began to set.


CHAPTER IX
AT CHEYNE WALK
IN the twilight that night Betty stole out
alone, and walked by herself up the path
by the river where Rafe had given her the
golden buttons. Here, all hidden by the trees,
turning to the west where the afterglow was
like the rosy blush on her own face, she let out
her soul in thankfulness to God. Then she
went home. That night she slept like a tired
child, and never woke till the glad sun, peering
in at her windows, recalled her to what the day
might bring forth.
All that morning she moved with the ordered
routine of her life, and no one in the household
saw enough change to cause a thought.
When, however, the noon had turned, Betty
went to her room and made her toilet most
carefully. The time since Rafe had seen her
seemed so long that she feared it might have


185
left some stamp upon her, and anxiously she
used her glass as every good woman does ; for
a good woman is a true woman, and her glass
-next to her Bible—is ever her help in self-respect. 
She put on once again the white
dress in which she had parted from Rafe, and
the gaps where the two buttons were missing
were unmistakable. Then she stole down to
the drawing-room and sat in her old place on the
sofa where she had used to sit with Rafe. It
was many a day since she had sat in the spot,
for she had felt that to sit there was to hope
too much, and if she hoped too much some
tinge of blame might rest on Rafe. But now
she was assured, and she need no longer deny
herself the sweet luxury.
After a while Abigail came into the room and
looked around, but not seeing her mistress in
her accustomed seat by the window, turned
to go out. Betty called to her -
I am here, Abigail !
“Dear heart alive! Miss Betty, I never
looked for you in that seat. I did but want
to ask if you will walk or ride after dinner.”
Neither, Abigail. I think I shall sit quiet
this afternoon. I had a long day in London
yesterday, and I daresay it tired me.
" 'Deed, then, Miss Betty, I feared so at



186
first; but when I saw you come home I thought
you never looked less tired in your life. But
it's the way with young maids—they're not
tired when they are, and when they are they're
not!" with which seemingly incomprehensible
piece of wisdom she withdrew.
The time seemed to Betty to fly with leaden
wings that afternoon. She would not let herself
come to any definite conclusion as to what she
even hoped, but held surmise, of joy and pain
alike, at arm's length. Of one thing she was
certain that she knew what she intended as
to the result. The manner of it and the means
were all that were left open. After dinner she
took her seat in the window, ostensibly reading
the last part of Mr. Pope's “Homer”; but the
pages were unturned. From her seat she
could watch the roadway for some little distance ;
no one could come near the house without
being seen by her, though the screen of flowers
which grew in their pots on the window-ledge
hid her from strange eyes.
The clock had just struck four when her heart
leaped, for her eyes, raised from her book, had
lighted on the form she looked for. There
was no fear of her mistaking that upright
carriage, that swinging gait. She peered
between the leaves of the plants, and her


187
hungry eyes lit on Rafe's face. And then,
oh! the tumult of joy in her heart ! He was
unchanged save in all manly and noble ways.
The pain, and suffering, and responsibility, and
high endeavour of the years that had passed
had only purified and ennobled his face. Her
glance well justified the opinion she had formed
the evening before from his voice and words.
She did not dare to look long, but with a light
bound and with noiseless foot flew back to her
old seat on the sofa, and waited with the throbbing 
of her heart stilled by the magnitude of
her expectancy. Then came the knock, and
Abigail herself flew to open the door. The old
woman may have taken some hint from seeing
Betty in her old seat, and her intuition grasped
the rest ; or it may simply have been that she
recognised the knock. None ever knew, not
even she herself, for none ever asked; but she
threw open the door, and recoiled with a half-
smothered cry-
“ Master Rafe! oh my dear young master!”
She threw her arms impulsively round him,
and instantly drew back. “Forgive me,” she
said, “I forgot my duty.” Then in a louder
and more ceremonious voice, and with a certain
ominous stiffening of her back which of old the
children had come to recognise as a sort of


188
storm signal, she went on : “The mistress has
been looking out for you, sir. She was much
distressed that you had not called sooner.”
Looking out for me!” said Rafe, in amazement, 
for in his new simplicity of thought, and
with his mind concentrated on the last twenty-four 
hours, he overlooked the longer time.
“Looking for me! Since when ?”
Only for the last five years, sir !” said the
old nurse, with mingled dignity and sarcasm.
A sweet smile broke over Rafe's face as he took
her by the hand : .
" You are right, my dear, good soul. The
time has been long ; but be assured it has not
gone quickly with me. I can only hope that
you who so love Miss Betty will in time forgive 
me.”
“Dear heart! but I must go break it to
the child that you are come.” She retired
demurely as far as the foot of the staircase, and
then ran with what speed her old legs could
make to the drawing-room. Her method of
breaking it was her own. She darted into
the door and called in a fierce, joyous whisper-
“ He is here, Miss Betty ! He is here!
and looking finer than ever. Let me see,
darling, that you are looking your best !” and
she eyed her mistress critically for an instant,


189
Then she retired, seemingly satisfied, as Betty
said in grand simplicity-
"Tell him to come up, Abigail dear. You
need not announce!”
Abigail flew to the stair-head; and thence
coming down with sedateness and decorum,
gave her message-
“My mistress will receive you, sir, in the
drawing-room. You will excuse me accompanying 
you, but my orders are that I am not
to announce you!”
Rafe smiled at her so sweetly that in her
secret heart she forgave him on the spot.
Then she stayed silent, keeping a jealous
watch lest any of the maids should by any
bungling accident make interruption of her
mistress.
Betty sat silent-silent and still as death.
She heard Rafe's footsteps on the carpeted
stair, and wondered why they were so slow.
How she would have flown had she been
going to him! But he was a man, and it was
her place to await him; the sweetness of the
coming moments was not to be forestalled.
The door opened and closed again, and she
looked up. Before her stood Rafe, more erect
than ever as to his body, for his years of
soldiering had perfected his bearing. But his


190
head was slightly drooped ; the long years of
hopes, of fears, of imaginings, told their tale
when now he stood in the presence of the
woman who had been his very sunlight.
There was no need for him to speak. Had
she not known already, Betty would have
understood by instinct the meaning of that
humble bearing. The lesson of her own
patient years of hoping and waiting were not
lost ; and face to face these two loving
hearts realised that for them time had stood
still, and the golden days of their lives had
even to begin. All Betty's joy and pride and
hope and love shone in her sweet eyes as she
rose to her feet, and with one glad word-
Rafe!"_whose tone was music to the man
who heard, and to the angels who smiled
approvingly-fairly leaped to the arms which
opened to receive her.
When they sat again in their old place on
the sofa, Betty said, as she held his hand and
pressed it to her side in the sweet old fashion
of her childhood
“Rafe dear, I have a confession to make ;
you must forgive me, for I could not help what
I did."
“Granted, my dear one, whatever it may
be,” said Rafe, and it need hardly be said


191
he took advantage of the occasion for another
kiss.
“I was in Cousin Fenton's study last afternoon!” 
She paused, for Rafe instinctively
stood up. " Nay, you must sit again and be
my prisoner !” She held out her hands, and as
he extended his to take them his scarred
wrists became exposed beneath the ruffles.
With a low cry, almost a sob, Betty drew them
to her and bent down and kissed them. “Oh!
Rafe,” she said, “the word is a pang to me,
for it wrought these cruel wounds!” Then she
smiled through her tears as she went on : “ 'Tis
I who am the prisoner now, but oh how different!
for my chains are of light, and music, and
flowers and love, whilst these--” and she
bent over, despite Rafe's protest, and kissed
the scars again.
For an instant Rafe said nothing ; then he
spoke with a grave solemnity that Betty never
forgot all her life long-
“ I grieve beyond measure that I must come
to you with such a scar. Therefore, oh! my
dear one, be most kind to me and turn not
against me the arrows of my own conscience.
Though it be true that these scars come about
from no shameful cause at man's hands, yet I
may not forget that they are justly given


192
at the hands of God. I have come to
realise, Betty, something of the wonder of
His ways; the sowing and the reaping
is all in just measure though men know not
or care not at the seed-time what grain it is
that they scatter. Be not deceived, God is
not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth that
shall he also reap.' These scars shall be
warnings to me for all my life ; till at the last,
if it may be in God's good time, the hands
that bear them shall lie folded over a peaceful
heart.”
Betty took the two maimed hands in hers
and held them to her heart as she answered-
“You are right, Rafe: they must be guides
to us both. I must share in all things; and
then you will truly feel that you have won
something for me too out of that bitter time!”
Then she went on :
“I had come into the house in Finsbury
Square through the garden, and no one saw
me. I had fallen asleep in Cousin Fenton's
own chair, and I was only awakened by his
coming—and yours. I listened to all, Rafe. I
could not help it; for at the first I was spellbound, 
and then afraid to stir. And then-
then, oh! Rafe, when I heard your brave words
and knew of the noble doubt that was in your


193
heart, I did not want to go, for I feared that
then any movement might have turned things
awry, and I hoped—oh! Rafe, how I hoped !
that your trust in my love would win in that
struggle, and that you would come to me as
one knowing.”
Here she faltered, and her voice broke.
With a silent gush of tears she laid her head
on her lover's breast, and her arms went
instinctively round his neck. Rafe soothed
her and stroked her sunny hair, and when
he thought she was not aware of it, kissed
the tresses. But this did not pass unknown,
though Betty said nothing, in sweet hope that
the transgression might be repeated. The
years that had passed had changed Betty from
a girl into a woman, and though her heart and
mind retained all their bashfulness, there was
a new yielding to the sweet impulses which
came to her, as to all the daughters of Eve.
The years had made a new hunger of the
heart, and when she felt her lover in her arms,
and heard his heart beat close to hers, she
wanted something more than the simple assurance 
that he would not leave her again.
And so the two sat silent till even Abigail at
the stair-foot was satisfied that the reconciliation, 
if there were need of one, was complete


194
and hurried to the kitchen and the
still-room to see that a worthy supper was
provided. By and by she went to the drawing-room 
to learn her mistress's commands ;
and though she was delayed by a distressing
cough of sudden oncoming, which took her in
the hall, and lasted with increasing violence
till her hand was on the door, she made her
entrance at last. When she saw Rafe and
Betty sitting as of old on the sofa—for the
sound of her coughing had driven them apart
--the tears of gladness rushed unbidden to her
eyes; which seeing, Betty flew to her, and,
putting her arms round her, kissed them away.
Rafe came over to her, and, taking her hand,
said in his old, boyish way-
" Abigail, I must have a kiss too. For all
your loving care of Betty when I was away
who should have been at her side ; for all your
hope and cheer and belief; for the tenderness
and love and care, you must count me your
friend and servant so long as we both shall
live!” and stooping over her he kissed the old
wrinkled cheek which blushed like a maiden's
under his caress.
In order to put herself at ease again,
Abigail said, in as natural a way as she could
manage-


195
“What are your commands for supper, Miss
Betty ? ”
“ All! all ! everything !” said Betty, dancing
round the room like a happy child. · Kill the
fatted calf, Abigail! Kill the whole herd of
them. Rafe is come home! Rafe is come
home!”
“ Dear heart !” said Abigail, looking at her
with glad eyes, and taking Rafe into her confidence 
with a look. Betty suddenly stopped
and said-
" And oh! Abigail, lay another cover, for I
should not be surprised if Cousin Fenton were
to join us at supper.”
“ La, Miss Betty, surely his lordship wouldn't
come out here at this hour all by himself; and
him not knowing whether you are at home.”
"Perhaps not, Abigail ; but I should make
ready for him anyway, lest by chance he should
come.”
So Abigail went off to add to her preparations; 
for a gentleman who had once been
Lord Mayor of London was to her of no small
importance. From the day of Mayoralty he
had never been to her anything but “His
Lordship” or “My Lord.”
It was not long before there was another
knock at the door, hesitating and unobtrusive,


196
and Abigail herself flew to open it. Visitors
at such an hour were rare enough, and to-night,
when there was every reason for keeping
strangers at their distance, the faithful guardian
would not trust to any less responsible person
the answering of queries. Her first thought
was that Miss Betty's prophecy was true, and
that Alderman Fenton had arrived; but that
could not be, for there was no sound of wheels,
not even of hoof-strokes, as would have been
had he ridden. So it was with a certain curiosity 
that she opened the door. Her wonder
was in no wise lessened when she saw that the
guest was none other than the Alderman himself—the 
late Lord Mayor-His Lordship—all
alone and on foot, and looking no more than
an ordinary and unofficial man ! Abigail's
wonder grew, as with admonitory finger on lip
he stepped into the hall, and himself closed the
door softly behind him. She waited in respectful 
silence for him to speak, yet not without a
secret bridling, which would have manifested
itself to any one unsheltered by the memory of
Lord Mayoral state. The Alderman asked
“Has your mistress had any visitors today?”
Abigail, under ordinary circumstances, would
have blurted out the whole matter ; but since


197
there was a mystery, she felt that she should
best help herself to some clue by being as
uncommunicative as might be. Out of the
very questions put to her she might be able to
construe something, so she swiftly answered-
“Yes, my lord !”
Then the Alderman got even more vague.
“ Ladies ?"
“No, my lord."
“At what time was the visit paid ?”
“After dinner, my lord.”
" At what time did they go ?'
" Not yet, my lord.”
" Good! How many gentlemen were there
in the party ?” Abigail began to see daylight.
"Only one, my lord !”
“Good! Do you know him ?"
The old man was manifestly perturbed in
his mind as he asked this question. So Abigail's 
eagerness to tell and her respect for his
dignity combined with her liking for him—for
he was very dear to Miss Betty and had
always been kind to herself—all worked in the
direction he wished ; putting her mouth close
to his ear she whispered exultingly--
“ 'Tis Master Rafe come home; and oh!
my dear lord, this is a joyful house this
night!”


198
The old Alderman sank down on the high-
backed settle in the hall and covered his face
with his hands.
“Now God be thanked !” he said, and when
he took his hands away Abigail saw that his
eyes were wet. She too was moved, and as
she raised the corner of her apron to her eyes,
he bent over, took both her hands, and said-
"Good Mistress Abigail, the faithful friend
of that dear child, we old folks, methinks, are
those that have the youngest hearts still.
Only that we cry with joy when the time has
gone by that we can cry at sorrow. I have
been so anxious—in such suspense—that I
was afraid almost to know the truth I sought.
How did she receive him?"
The old woman shook her head :
“That I don't know, my lord, but I take it
that there wasn't any great quarrel between
them, for when I was up there awhile gone
they was sitting together on the sofy as they
used to sit.”
The Alderman paused, and then with some
diffidence he said-
“Do you think now, Mistress Abigail, that
I might go up just for a little while?”
“ Dear heart, now! but you came that quiet
that I quite forgot. Miss Betty told me herself


199
self to lay a cover for you for supper,for that
she wouldn't be surprised if you looked in this
evening. To think of it! She must be a
witch !”
" Then go and ask her, if you please, Mistress
Abigail, if she will care to receive me this
evening ?”
Abigail departed at once on her errand. A
moment later Betty came flying down the
stairs, calling out-
" Where is he? He must have come very
quietly, for I never heard him!” and she threw
her arms round him and kissed him. “Come
upstairs,” she said. “I was hoping you would
come, for I have something to tell you.”
Arm in arm they came back to the drawing-room 
where Rafe was standing at the door.
As they drew close, each man extended a hand.
Betty, taking them, placed them together and
put both her own hands over the clasped 
ones. The Alderman was about to speak
when Betty began, so he waited.
“ Cousin Fenton I have a confession to
make, and you must let me make it now. I
was sitting in your own chair in your study
last evening when you talked with Rafe.”
His surprise overmastered him. “God bless
My soul! I hope you didn't hear-"


200
" Oh yes, I did ! thank God! I did. For I
wouldn't for anything miss out of my life that
conversation of two men whom I love and
honour. Rafe knows what I think of him; or
perhaps he knows a little—it will take a longer
time to let him know it all!" and she looked at
him lovingly. “But you know up to now only
that I am an eavesdropper. How am I to
thank you? You know what I mean! I
know your kindness and your sympathy
already-1-I shall try to show you some day,”
and once again the sweet eyes were filled with
tears, but this time they were of pure joy.
My dear old friend, your wish has come
true; the good God is giving me my heart's
desire."
They all three went and sat on the sofa,
Betty being between the two men and holding
a hand of each ; and the time seemed to have
flown by too quickly when Abigail came and
announced that supper was served. Betty
took her cousin's arm and smiled at Rafe as
she did so, saying to the Alderman but so that
Rafe could hear-
“A hostess must not be taken down by her
husband ; and Rafe is not far from that now !”
The blush on her face as she spoke was a poem
in itself.


201
That was a happy meal; and if there was
any of the three who sat at meat, or any of
those who waited on them, who was not content
no sign of the feeling was evidenced.
not late when Rafe and the Alderman went
away together; for in Cheyne Walk they kept
early hours, and the road to London was one
which had its own anxieties. Rafe took a little
longer to say goodbye than his elder, who did
not, however, seem impatient as he stood chatting 
in the hall with Abigail ; but when he
came running down the stairs Betty's sweet
"goodbye” followed his footsteps like
blessing
The Alderman had left his carriage at the
inn at Chelsea, and they drove to town together. 
On the way Mr. Fenton learned where
Rafe was staying, and drove straight to the
place and took away his belongings. Rafe
remonstrated, he feared he might give trouble ;
but the Alderman would hear no denial.
Willy-nilly he must stay in his house till the
happy time came when he would be with
Betty.
· Tut man!” he said ; “d'ye think that I
would let Betty's husband lie at an inn? The
dear lass! When she told me to take her to
supper and gave her reason I seemed to see


202
the time come already that please God will
come. She and you going through life hand in
hand, trusting each other and taking light to
guide yourselves and others out of the troubles
that are behind. I hope to see you with your
children at your knees, teaching them how to
grow into good men and women, and making
the world the more like what God would
have it because you both have lived in it!”
Rafe reverently lifted his hat, and as he
raised his hands the back flash of the carriage
lamps showed his scarred wrists, and he said —
“God helping us, your vision will be true."
It must be taken that God did help them ;
for the record of all their lives showed that
the old man's insight had not deceived him.
THE END.
